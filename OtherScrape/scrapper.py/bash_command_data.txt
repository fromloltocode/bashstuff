Options--no-install-recommends
        Do not consider recommended packages as a dependency for installing.
        Configuration Item: APT::Install-Recommends.

   -d, --download-only
        Download only; package files are only retrieved, not unpacked or installed.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download-Only.

   -f, --fix-broken
        Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place.
        This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to permit APT to
        deduce a likely solution. If packages are specified, these have to completely correct
        the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when running APT for the first time;
        APT itself does not allow broken package dependencies to exist on a system.
        It is possible that a system's dependency structure can be so corrupt as to require
        manual intervention (which usually means using dselect(1) or dpkg --remove
        to eliminate some of the offending packages).
        Use of this option together with -m may produce an error in some situations.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken.

   -m, --ignore-missing, --fix-missing
        Ignore missing packages; If packages cannot be retrieved or fail the integrity check after retrieval
        (corrupted package files), hold back those packages and handle the result.
        Use of this option together with -f might produce an error in some situations.

        If a package is selected for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the command line)
        and it could not be downloaded then it will be silently held back.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Missing.

   --no-download
        Disables downloading of packages. This is best used with --ignore-missing to force APT to use 
        only the .debs it has already downloaded. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download.

   -q, --quiet
        Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators.
        More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum of 2.
        You can also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding the  configuration file.

        Note that quiet level 2 implies -y, you should never use -qq without a no-action modifier
        such as -d, --print-uris or -s as APT decided to do something you did not expect.
        Configuration Item: quiet.

   -s, --simulate, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon, --no-act
        No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do not actually change the system.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Simulate.

        Simulation run as user will deactivate locking (Debug::NoLocking)  automatic.
        Also a notice will be displayed indicating that this is only a simulation, if the option
        APT::Get::Show-User-Simulation-Note is set (Default: true). Neither  NoLocking nor the
        notice will be triggered if run as root (root should know what she is doing without
        further warnings by apt-get).

        Simulate prints out a series of lines each one representing a dpkg operation, Configure (Conf),
        Remove (Remv), Unpack (Inst). Square brackets indicate broken packages and empty set of square
        brackets meaning breaks that are of no consequence (rare).

   -y, --yes, --assume-yes
        Automatic yes to prompts; assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively.
        If an undesirable situation, such as changing a held package, trying to install a unauthenticated
        package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will exit.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.

   -u, --show-upgraded
        Show upgraded packages; Print out a list of all packages that are to be upgraded.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Upgraded.

   -V, --verbose-versions
        Show full versions for upgraded and installed packages.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Show-Versions.

   -b, --compile, --build
        Compile source packages after downloading them.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Compile.

   --install-recommends
        Also install recommended packages.

   --no-install-recommends
        Do not install recommended packages.

   --ignore-hold
        Ignore package Holds; This causes apt-get to ignore a hold placed on a package.
        This can be useful in conjunction with dist-upgrade to override a large number of undesired holds.
        Configuration Item: APT::Ignore-Hold.

   --no-upgrade
        Do not upgrade packages; When used in conjunction with install, no-upgrade will prevent packages on the
        command line from being upgraded if they are already installed.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Upgrade.

   --force-yes
        Force yes; This is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue without prompting if
        it is doing something potentially harmful. It should not be used except in very special
        situations. Using force-yes can potentially destroy your system!
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::force-yes.

   --print-uris
        Instead of fetching the files to install their URIs are printed.Each URI will have the path,
        the destination file name, the size and the expected md5 hash.
        Note that the file name to write to will  not always match the file name on the remote site!
        This also works with the source and update commands.

        When used with the update command the MD5 and size are not included, and it is up to the user
        to decompress any compressed files.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Print-URIs.

   --purge
        Use purge instead of remove for anything that would be removed. An asterisk ("*") will be displayed
        next to packages which are scheduled to be purged.
        remove --purge is equivalent to the purge command.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Purge.

   --reinstall
        Re-Install packages that are already installed and at the newest version.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::ReInstall.

   --list-cleanup
        This option defaults to on, use --no-list-cleanup to turn it off.
        When on apt-get will automatically manage the contents of  /var/lib/apt/lists to ensure that
        obsolete files are erased. The only reason to turn it off is if you frequently change your source
        list. Configuration Item: APT::Get::List-Cleanup.

   -t, --target-release, --default-release
        This option controls the default input to the policy engine, it creates a default pin at priority
        990 using the specified releases tring.
        This overrides the general settings in /etc/apt/preferences.
        Specifically pinned packages are not affected by the value of this option.
        In short, this option lets you have simple control over which distribution packages will be retrieved from.
          
        Some common examples might be -t '2.1*', -t unstable or -t sid. 
        Configuration Item: APT::Default-Release; see also the apt_preferences(5) man page.

   --trivial-only
        Only perform operations that are 'trivial'. Logically this can be considered related to --assume-yes,
        where --assume-yes will answer yes to any prompt, --trivial-only will answer no.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Trivial-Only.

   --no-remove
        If any packages are to be removed apt-get immediately exits without prompting.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Remove.

   --auto-remove
        If the command is either install or remove, then this option acts like running autoremove command,
        removing the unused dependency packages.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::AutomaticRemove.

   --only-source
        Only has meaning for the source and build-dep commands. Indicates that the given source
        names are not to be mapped through the binary table.
        This means that if this option is specified, these commands will only accept source package names
        as arguments, rather than accepting binary package names and looking up the corresponding
        source package. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Only-Source.

   --diff-only, --dsc-only, --tar-only
        Download only the diff, dsc, or tar file of a source archive.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Diff-Only, APT::Get::Dsc-Only, and APT::Get::Tar-Only.

   --arch-only
        Only process architecture-dependent build-dependencies.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::Arch-Only.

   --allow-unauthenticated
        Ignore if packages can't be authenticated and don't prompt about it.
        This is useful for tools like pbuilder.
        Configuration Item: APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.

   -h, --help
        Show a short usage summary.

   -v, --version
        Show the program version.

   -c, --config-file
        Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use.
        The program will read the default configuration file and then this configuration file.
        See apt.conf(5) for syntax information.

   -o, --option
        Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option.
        The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o and --option can be used multiple times
        to set different options.

Keyinstall

           Install one or more packages. The packages should be listed after
           the “install” command; if a package name contains a tilde character
           (“~”) or a question mark (“?”), it will be treated as a search
           pattern and every package matching the pattern will be installed
           (see the section “Search Patterns” in the aptitude reference
           manual).

           To select a particular version of the package, append “=<version>”
           to the package name: for instance, “aptitude install apt=0.3.1”.
           Similarly, to select a package from a particular archive, append
           “/<archive>” to the package name: for instance, “aptitude install
           apt/experimental”.

           Not every package listed on the command line has to be installed;
           you can tell aptitude to do something different with a package by
           appending an “override specifier” to the name of the package. For
           example, aptitude remove wesnoth+ will install wesnoth, not remove
           it. The following override specifiers are available:

           <package>+

               Install <package>.

           <package>+M
               Install <package> and immediately mark it as automatically
               installed (note that if nothing depends on <package>, this will
               cause it to be immediately removed).

           <package>-

               Remove <package>.

           <package>_
               Purge <package>: remove it and all its associated configuration
               and data files.

           <package>=
               Place <package> on hold: cancel any active installation,
               upgrade, or removal, and prevent this package from being
               automatically upgraded in the future.

           <package>:

               Keep <package> at its current version: cancel any installation,
               removal, or upgrade. Unlike “hold” (above) this does not
               prevent automatic upgrades in the future.

           <package>&M
               Mark <package> as having been automatically installed.

           <package>&m
               Mark <package> as having been manually installed.

           As a special case, “install” with no arguments will act on any
           stored/pending actions.

               Note

               Once you enter Y at the final confirmation prompt, the
               “install” command will modify aptitude's stored information
               about what actions to perform. Therefore, if you issue (e.g.)
               the command “aptitude install foo bar” and then exit the
               installation once aptitude has started downloading and
               installing packages, you will need to run “aptitude remove foo

               bar” to cancel that order.

       remove, purge, hold, unhold, keep, reinstall
           These commands are the same as “install”, but apply the named
           action to all packages given on the command line for which it is
           not overridden. The difference between hold and keep is that hold

           will cause a package to be ignored by future safe-upgrade or
           full-upgrade commands, while keep merely cancels any scheduled
           actions on the package.  unhold will allow a package to be upgraded
           by future safe-upgrade or full-upgrade commands, without otherwise
           altering its state.

           For instance, “aptitude remove '~ndeity'” will remove all packages
           whose name contains “deity”.

       markauto, unmarkauto

           Mark packages as automatically installed or manually installed,
           respectively. Packages are specified in exactly the same way as for
           the “install” command. For instance, “aptitude markauto '~slibs'”
           will mark all packages in the “libs” section as having been
           automatically installed.

           For more information on automatically installed packages, see the
           section “Managing Automatically Installed Packages” in the aptitude
           reference manual.

       build-depends, build-dep

           Satisfy the build-dependencies of a package. Each package name may
           be a source package, in which case the build dependencies of that
           source package are installed; otherwise, binary packages are found
           in the same way as for the “install” command, and the
           build-dependencies of the source packages that build those binary
           packages are satisfied.

           If the command-line parameter --arch-only is present, only
           architecture-dependent build dependencies (i.e., not
           Build-Depends-Indep or Build-Conflicts-Indep) will be obeyed.

       forbid-version
           Forbid a package from being upgraded to a particular version. This
           will prevent aptitude from automatically upgrading to this version,
           but will allow automatic upgrades to future versions. By default,
           aptitude will select the version to which the package would
           normally be upgraded; you can override this selection by appending
           “=<version>” to the package name: for instance, “aptitude

           forbid-version vim=1.2.3.broken-4”.

           This command is useful for avoiding broken versions of packages
           without having to set and clear manual holds. If you decide you
           really want the forbidden version after all, the “install” command
           will remove the ban.

       update
           Updates the list of available packages from the apt sources (this
           is equivalent to “apt-get update”)

       safe-upgrade

           Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version. Installed
           packages will not be removed unless they are unused (see the
           section “Managing Automatically Installed Packages” in the aptitude
           reference manual). Packages which are not currently installed may
           be installed to resolve dependencies unless the --no-new-installs
           command-line option is supplied.

           It is sometimes necessary to remove one package in order to upgrade
           another; this command is not able to upgrade packages in such
           situations. Use the full-upgrade command to upgrade as many
           packages as possible.

       full-upgrade
           Upgrades installed packages to their most recent version, removing
           or installing packages as necessary. This command is less
           conservative than safe-upgrade and thus more likely to perform
           unwanted actions. However, it is capable of upgrading packages that
           safe-upgrade cannot upgrade.

               Note

               This command was originally named dist-upgrade for historical
               reasons, and aptitude still recognizes dist-upgrade as a
               synonym for full-upgrade.

       keep-all
           Cancels all scheduled actions on all packages; any packages whose
           sticky state indicates an installation, removal, or upgrade will
           have this sticky state cleared.

       forget-new

           Forgets all internal information about what packages are “new”
           (equivalent to pressing “f” when in visual mode).

       search
           Searches for packages matching one of the patterns supplied on the
           command line. All packages which match any of the given patterns
           will be displayed; for instance, “aptitude search '~N' edit” will
           list all “new” packages and all packages whose name contains
           “edit”. For more information on search patterns, see the section
           “Search Patterns” in the aptitude reference manual.

           Unless you pass the -F option, the output of aptitude search will
           look something like this:

               i   apt             - Advanced front-end for dpkg
               pi  apt-build       - frontend to apt to build, optimize and in
               cp  apt-file        - APT package searching utility -- command-
               ihA raptor-utils    - Raptor RDF Parser utilities

           Each search result is listed on a separate line. The first
           character of each line indicates the current state of the package:
           the most common states are p, meaning that no trace of the package
           exists on the system, c, meaning that the package was deleted but
           its configuration files remain on the system, i, meaning that the
           package is installed, and v, meaning that the package is virtual.
           The second character indicates the stored action (if any; otherwise
           a blank space is displayed) to be performed on the package, with
           the most common actions being i, meaning that the package will be
           installed, d, meaning that the package will be deleted, and p,
           meaning that the package and its configuration files will be
           removed. If the third character is A, the package was automatically
           installed.

           For a complete list of the possible state and action flags, see the
           section “Accessing Package Information” in the aptitude reference
           guide. To customize the output of search, see the command-line
           options -F and --sort.

       show

           Displays detailed information about one or more packages, listed
           following the search command. If a package name contains a tilde
           character (“~”) or a question mark (“?”), it will be treated as a
           search pattern and all matching packages will be displayed (see the
           section “Search Patterns” in the aptitude reference manual).

           If the verbosity level is 1 or greater (i.e., at least one -v is
           present on the command-line), information about all versions of the
           package is displayed. Otherwise, information about the “candidate
           version” (the version that “aptitude install” would download) is
           displayed.

           You can display information about a different version of the
           package by appending =<version> to the package name; you can
           display the version from a particular archive by appending
           /<archive> to the package name. If either of these is present, then
           only the version you request will be displayed, regardless of the
           verbosity level.

           If the verbosity level is 1 or greater, the package's architecture,
           compressed size, filename, and md5sum fields will be displayed. If
           the verbosity level is 2 or greater, the select version or versions
           will be displayed once for each archive in which they are found.

       add-user-tag, remove-user-tag

           Adds a user tag to or removes a user tag from the selected group of
           packages. If a package name contains a tilde (“~”) or question mark
           (“?”), it is treated as a search pattern and the tag is added to or
           removed from all the packages that match the pattern (see the
           section “Search Patterns” in the aptitude reference manual).

           User tags are arbitrary strings associated with a package. They can
           be used with the ?user-tag(<tag>) search term, which will select
           all the packages that have a user tag matching <tag>.

       why, why-not

           Explains the reason that a particular package should or cannot be
           installed on the system.

           This command searches for packages that require or conflict with
           the given package. It displays a sequence of dependencies leading
           to the target package, along with a note indicating the installed
           state of each package in the dependency chain:

               $ aptitude why kdepim
               i   nautilus-data Recommends nautilus
               i A nautilus      Recommends desktop-base (>= 0.2)
               i A desktop-base  Suggests   gnome | kde | xfce4 | wmaker
               p   kde           Depends    kdepim (>= 4:3.4.3)

           The command why finds a dependency chain that installs the package
           named on the command line, as above. Note that the dependency that
           aptitude produced in this case is only a suggestion. This is
           because no package currently installed on this computer depends on
           or recommends the kdepim package; if a stronger dependency were
           available, aptitude would have displayed it.

           In contrast, why-not finds a dependency chain leading to a conflict
           with the target package:

               $ aptitude why-not textopo
               i   ocaml-core          Depends   ocamlweb
               i A ocamlweb            Depends   tetex-extra | texlive-latex-extra
               i A texlive-latex-extra Conflicts textopo

           If one or more <pattern>s are present, then aptitude will begin its
           search at these patterns; that is, the first package in the chain
           it prints will be a package matching the pattern in question. The
           patterns are considered to be package names unless they contain a
           tilde character (“~”) or a question mark (“?”), in which case they
           are treated as search patterns (see the section “Search Patterns”
           in the aptitude reference manual).

           If no patterns are present, then aptitude will search for
           dependency chains beginning at manually installed packages. This
           effectively shows the packages that have caused or would cause a
           given package to be installed.

               Note

               aptitude why does not perform full dependency resolution; it
               only displays direct relationships between packages. For
               instance, if A requires B, C requires D, and B and C conflict,
               “aptitude why-not D” will not produce the answer “A depends on
               B, B conflicts with C, and D depends on C”.
           By default aptitude outputs only the “most installed, strongest,
           tightest, shortest” dependency chain. That is, it looks for a chain
           that only contains packages which are installed or will be
           installed; it looks for the strongest possible dependencies under
           that restriction; it looks for chains that avoid ORed dependencies
           and Provides; and it looks for the shortest dependency chain
           meeting those criteria. These rules are progressively weakened
           until a match is found.

           If the verbosity level is 1 or more, then all the explanations
           aptitude can find will be displayed, in inverse order of relevance.
           If the verbosity level is 2 or more, a truly excessive amount of
           debugging information will be printed to standard output.

           This command returns 0 if successful, 1 if no explanation could be
           constructed, and -1 if an error occured.

       clean

           Removes all previously downloaded .deb files from the package cache
           directory (usually /var/cache/apt/archives).

       autoclean
           Removes any cached packages which can no longer be downloaded. This
           allows you to prevent a cache from growing out of control over time
           without completely emptying it.

       changelog
           Downloads and displays the Debian changelog for each of the given
           source or binary packages.

           By default, the changelog for the version which would be installed
           with “aptitude install” is downloaded. You can select a particular
           version of a package by appending =<version> to the package name;
           you can select the version from a particular archive by appending
           /<archive> to the package name.

       download

           Downloads the .deb file for the given package to the current
           directory. If a package name contains a tilde character (“~”) or a
           question mark (“?”), it will be treated as a search pattern and all
           the matching packages will be downloaded (see the section “Search
           Patterns” in the aptitude reference manual).

           By default, the version which would be installed with “aptitude
           install” is downloaded. You can select a particular version of a
           package by appending =<version> to the package name; you can select
           the version from a particular archive by appending /<archive> to
           the package name.

       extract-cache-subset

           Copy the apt configuration directory (/etc/apt) and a subset of the
           package database to the specified directory. If no packages are
           listed, the entire package database is copied; otherwise only the
           entries corresponding to the named packages are copied. Each
           package name can be a search pattern, and all the packages matching
           that pattern will be selected (see the section “Search Patterns” in
           the aptitude reference manual). Any existing package database files
           in the output directory will be overwritten.

           Dependencies in binary package stanzas will be rewritten to remove
           references to packages not in the selected set.

       help
           Displays a brief summary of the available commands and options.The following options can be used to modify the behavior of the actions
       described above. Note that while all options will be accepted for all
       commands, some options don't apply to particular commands and will be
       ignored by those commands.

       --add-user-tag <tag>

           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade, forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold,
           and unmarkauto: add the user tag <tag> to all packages that are
           installed, removed, or upgraded by this command as if with the
           add-user-tag command.

       --add-user-tag-to <tag>,<pattern>

           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold,
           and unmarkauto: add the user tag <tag> to all packages that match
           <pattern> as if with the add-user-tag command. The pattern is a
           search pattern as described in the section “Search Patterns” in the
           aptitude reference manual.

           For instance, aptitude safe-upgrade --add-user-tag-to

           "new-installs,?action(install)" will add the tag new-installs to
           all the packages installed by the safe-upgrade command.

       --allow-new-upgrades
           When the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was
           passed or Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), allow
           the dependency resolver to install upgrades for packages regardless
           of the value of Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Upgrades.

       --allow-new-installs

           Allow the safe-upgrade command to install new packages; when the
           safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was passed or
           Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), allow the
           dependency resolver to install new packages. This option takes
           effect regardless of the value of
           Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Installs.

       --allow-untrusted

           Install packages from untrusted sources without prompting. You
           should only use this if you know what you are doing, as it could
           easily compromise your system's security.

       --disable-columns
           This option causes aptitude search to output its results without
           any special formatting. In particular: normally aptitude will add
           whitespace or truncate search results in an attempt to fit its
           results into vertical “columns”. With this flag, each line will be
           formed by replacing any format escapes in the format string with
           the correponding text; column widths will be ignored.

           For instance, the first few lines of output from “aptitude search

           -F '%p %V' --disable-columns libedataserver” might be:

               disksearch 1.2.1-3
               hp-search-mac 0.1.3
               libbsearch-ruby 1.5-5
               libbsearch-ruby1.8 1.5-5
               libclass-dbi-abstractsearch-perl 0.07-2
               libdbix-fulltextsearch-perl 0.73-10

           As in the above example, --disable-columns is often useful in
           combination with a custom display format set using the command-line
           option -F.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Disable-Columns.

       -D, --show-deps

           For commands that will install or remove packages (install,
           full-upgrade, etc), show brief explanations of automatic
           installations and removals.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Deps.

       -d, --download-only
           Download packages to the package cache as necessary, but do not
           install or remove anything. By default, the package cache is stored
           in /var/cache/apt/archives.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Download-Only.

       -F <format>, --display-format <format>

           Specify the format which should be used to display output from the
           search command. For instance, passing “%p %V %v” for <format> will
           display a package's name, followed by its currently installed
           version and its available version (see the section “Customizing how
           packages are displayed” in the aptitude reference manual for more
           information).

           The command-line option --disable-columns is often useful in
           combination with -F.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Package-Display-Format.

       -f

           Try hard to fix the dependencies of broken packages, even if it
           means ignoring the actions requested on the command line.

           This corresponds to the configuration item
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Fix-Broken.

       --full-resolver
           When package dependency problems are encountered, use the default
           “full” resolver to solve them. Unlike the “safe” resolver activated
           by --safe-resolver, the full resolver will happily remove packages
           to fulfill dependencies. It can resolve more situations than the
           safe algorithm, but its solutions are more likely to be
           undesirable.

           This option can be used to force the use of the full resolver even
           when Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is true. The safe-upgrade
           command never uses the full resolver and does not accept the
           --full-resolver option.

       -h, --help

           Display a brief help message. Identical to the help action.

       --no-new-installs
           Prevent safe-upgrade from installing any new packages; when the
           safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was passed or
           Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), forbid the
           dependency resolver from installing new packages. This option takes
           effect regardless of the value of
           Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Installs.

           This mimics the historical behavior of apt-get upgrade.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Safe-Upgrade::No-New-Installs.

       --no-new-upgrades

           When the safe resolver is being used (i.e., --safe-resolver was
           passed or Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver is set to true), allow
           the dependency resolver to install new packages regardless of the
           value of Aptitude::Safe-Resolver::No-New-Installs.

       -O <order>, --sort <order>

           Specify the order in which output from the search command should be
           displayed. For instance, passing “installsize” for <order> will
           list packages in order according to their size when installed (see
           the section “Customizing how packages are sorted” in the aptitude
           reference manual for more information).

       -o <key>=<value>

           Set a configuration file option directly; for instance, use -o
           Aptitude::Log=/tmp/my-log to log aptitude's actions to /tmp/my-log.
           For more information on configuration file options, see the section
           “Configuration file reference” in the aptitude reference manual.

       -P, --prompt

           Always display a prompt before downloading, installing or removing
           packages, even when no actions other than those explicitly
           requested will be performed.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Always-Prompt.

       --purge-unused
           Purge packages that are no longer required by any installed
           package. This is equivalent to passing “-o
           Aptitude::Purge-Unused=true” as a command-line argument.

       -q[=<n>], --quiet[=<n>]
           Suppress all incremental progress indicators, thus making the
           output loggable. This can be supplied multiple times to make the
           program quieter, but unlike apt-get, aptitude does not enable -y

           when -q is supplied more than once.

           The optional =<n> can be used to directly set the amount of
           quietness (for instance, to override a setting in
           /etc/apt/apt.conf); it causes the program to behave as if -q had
           been passed exactly <n> times.

       -R, --without-recommends

           Do not treat recommendations as dependencies when installing new
           packages (this overrides settings in /etc/apt/apt.conf and
           ~/.aptitude/config). Packages previously installed due to
           recommendations will not be removed.

           This corresponds to the pair of configuration options
           Apt::Install-Recommends and Aptitude::Keep-Recommends.

       -r, --with-recommends
           Treat recommendations as dependencies when installing new packages
           (this overrides settings in /etc/apt/apt.conf and
           ~/.aptitude/config).

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Apt::Install-Recommends

       --remove-user-tag <tag>
           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold,
           and unmarkauto: remove the user tag <tag> from all packages that
           are installed, removed, or upgraded by this command as if with the
           add-user-tag command.

       --remove-user-tag-from <tag>,<pattern>

           For full-upgrade, safe-upgrade forbid-version, hold, install,
           keep-all, markauto, unmarkauto, purge, reinstall, remove, unhold,
           and unmarkauto: remove the user tag <tag> from all packages that
           match <pattern> as if with the remove-user-tag command. The pattern
           is a search pattern as described in the section “Search Patterns”
           in the aptitude reference manual.

           For instance, aptitude safe-upgrade --remove-user-tag-from

           "not-upgraded,?action(upgrade)" will remove the not-upgraded tag
           from all packages that the safe-upgrade command is able to upgrade.

       -s, --simulate
           In command-line mode, print the actions that would normally be
           performed, but don't actually perform them. This does not require
           root privileges. In the visual interface, always open the cache in
           read-only mode regardless of whether you are root.

           This corresponds to the configuration option Aptitude::Simulate.

       --safe-resolver

           When package dependency problems are encountered, use a “safe”
           algorithm to solve them. This resolver attempts to preserve as many
           of your choices as possible; it will never remove a package or
           install a version of a package other than the package's default
           candidate version. It is the same algorithm used in safe-upgrade;
           indeed, aptitude --safe-resolver full-upgrade is equivalent to
           aptitude safe-upgrade. Because safe-upgrade always uses the safe
           resolver, it does not accept the --safe-resolver flag.

           This option is equivalent to setting the configuration variable
           Aptitude::Always-Use-Safe-Resolver to true.

       --schedule-only

           For commands that modify package states, schedule operations to be
           performed in the future, but don't perform them. You can execute
           scheduled actions by running aptitude install with no arguments.
           This is equivalent to making the corresponding selections in visual
           mode, then exiting the program normally.

           For instance, aptitude --schedule-only install evolution will
           schedule the evolution package for later installation.

       -t <release>, --target-release <release>

           Set the release from which packages should be installed. For
           instance, “aptitude -t experimental ...”  will install packages
           from the experimental distribution unless you specify otherwise.
           For the command-line actions “changelog”, “download”, and “show”,
           this is equivalent to appending /<release> to each package named on
           the command-line; for other commands, this will affect the default
           candidate version of packages according to the rules described in
           apt_preferences(5).

           This corresponds to the configuration item APT::Default-Release.

       -V, --show-versions

           Show which versions of packages will be installed.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Versions.

       -v, --verbose
           Causes some commands (for instance, show) to display extra
           information. This can be supplied multiple times to get more and
           more information.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Verbose.

       --version
           Display the version of aptitude and some information about how it
           was compiled.

       --visual-preview

           When installing or removing packages from the command line, instead
           of displaying the usual prompt, start up the visual interface and
           display its preview screen.

       -W, --show-why
           In the preview displayed before packages are installed or removed,
           show which manually installed package requires each automatically
           installed package. For instance:

               $ aptitude --show-why install mediawiki
               ...
               The following NEW packages will be installed:
                 libapache2-mod-php5{a} (for mediawiki)  mediawiki  php5{a} (for mediawiki)
                 php5-cli{a} (for mediawiki)  php5-common{a} (for mediawiki)
                 php5-mysql{a} (for mediawiki)

           When combined with -v or a non-zero value for
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Verbose, this displays the entire chain of
           dependencies that lead each package to be installed. For instance:

               $ aptitude -v --show-why install libdb4.2-dev
               The following NEW packages will be installed:
                 libdb4.2{a} (libdb4.2-dev D: libdb4.2)  libdb4.2-dev
               The following packages will be REMOVED:
                 libdb4.4-dev{a} (libdb4.2-dev C: libdb-dev P<- libdb-dev)

           This option will also describe why packages are being removed, as
           shown above. In this example, libdb4.2-dev conflicts with
           libdb-dev, which is provided by libdb-dev.

           This argument corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Why and displays the same information that
           is computed by aptitude why and aptitude why-not.

       -w <width>, --width <width>

           Specify the display width which should be used for output from the
           search command (by default, the terminal width is used).

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Package-Display-Width

       -y, --assume-yes
           When a yes/no prompt would be presented, assume that the user
           entered “yes”. In particular, suppresses the prompt that appears
           when installing, upgrading, or removing packages. Prompts for
           “dangerous” actions, such as removing essential packages, will
           still be displayed. This option overrides -P.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Assume-Yes.

       -Z

           Show how much disk space will be used or freed by the individual
           packages being installed, upgraded, or removed.

           This corresponds to the configuration option
           Aptitude::CmdLine::Show-Size-Changes.

       The following options apply to the visual mode of the program, but are
       primarily for internal use; you generally won't need to use them
       yourself.

       -i
           Displays a download preview when the program starts (equivalent to
           starting the program and immediately pressing “g”). You cannot use
           this option and “-u” at the same time.

       -S <fname>
           Loads the extended state information from <fname> instead of the
           standard state file.

       -u

           Begins updating the package lists as soon as the program starts.
           You cannot use this option and -i at the same time.HOME
           If $HOME/.aptitude exists, aptitude will store its configuration
           file in $HOME/.aptitude/config. Otherwise, it will look up the
           current user's home directory using getpwuid(2) and place its
           configuration file there.

       PAGER
           If this environment variable is set, aptitude will use it to
           display changelogs when “aptitude changelog” is invoked. If not
           set, it defaults to more.

       TMP

           If TMPDIR is unset, aptitude will store its temporary files in TMP
           if that variable is set. Otherwise, it will store them in /tmp.

       TMPDIR

           aptitude will store its temporary files in the directory indicated
           by this environment variable. If TMPDIR is not set, then TMP will
           be used; if TMP is also unset, then aptitude will use /tmp./var/lib/aptitude/pkgstates
           The file in which stored package states and some package flags are
           stored.

       /etc/apt/apt.conf, /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*, ~/.aptitude/config
           The configuration files for aptitude.  ~/.aptitude/config overrides
           /etc/apt/apt.conf. See apt.conf(5) for documentation of the format
           and contents of these files.

      batch                     # Execute commands when system load levels permit.

Key
   -c    Cat the jobs listed on the command line to standard output.

   -d    Is an alias for atrm.

   -f file
         Read the job from file rather than standard input.

   -l    Is an alias for atq.

   -m    Send mail to the user when the job has completed even if there was no output.

   -q queue
         use the specified queue.
         A queue designation consists of a single letter; valid queue designations range from a to z.
         and A to Z. The a queue is the default for at and the b queue for batch.
         Queues with higher letters run with increased niceness.
         The special queue "=" is reserved for jobs which are currently running. If a job is submitted to a queue
         designated with an uppercase letter, the job is treated as if it were submitted to batch at the time of
         the job. Once the time is reached, the batch processing rules with respect to load average apply.
         If atq is given a specific queue, it will only show jobs pending in that queue.

   -t time_arg
         Submit the job to be run at the time specified by the time_arg option argument, which must have
         the same format as specified for the touch utility's -t time option argument ([[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm). 

   -v    Show the time the job will be executed before reading the job. 
         Times displayed will be in the format "Thu Feb 20 14:50:00 1997".

   -V    Print the version number to standard error.

awk or gawk (gnu awk)
Syntax

      awk <options> 'Program' Input-File1 Input-File2 ...

      awk -f PROGRAM-FILE <options> Input-File1 Input-File2 ...

Key
 -F FS
 --field-separator FS
     Use FS for the input field separator (the value of the 'FS'
     predefined variable).

 -f PROGRAM-FILE
 --file PROGRAM-FILE
     Read the awk program source from the file PROGRAM-FILE, instead
     of from the first command line argument.

 -mf NNN
 -mr NNN
     The 'f' flag sets the maximum number of fields, and the 'r' flag
     sets the maximum record size.  These options are ignored by
     'gawk', since 'gawk' has no predefined limits; they are only for
     compatibility with the Bell Labs research version of Unix awk.

 -v VAR=VAL
 --assign VAR=VAL
     Assign the variable VAR the value VAL before program execution
     begins.

 -W traditional
 -W compat
 --traditional
 --compat
     Use compatibility mode, in which 'gawk' extensions are turned off.

 -W lint
 --lint
     Give warnings about dubious or non-portable awk constructs.

 -W lint-old
 --lint-old
     Warn about constructs that are not available in the original
     Version 7 Unix version of awk.

 -W posix
 --posix
     Use POSIX compatibility mode, in which 'gawk' extensions are
     turned off and additional restrictions apply.

 -W re-interval
 --re-interval
     Allow interval expressions, in regexps.

 -W source=PROGRAM-TEXT
 --source PROGRAM-TEXT
     Use PROGRAM-TEXT as awk program source code.  This option allows
     mixing command line source code with source code from files, and is
     particularly useful for mixing command line programs with library
     functions.

 --
     Signal the end of options.  This is useful to allow further
     arguments to the awk program itself to start with a '-'.  This
     is mainly for consistency with POSIX argument parsing conventions.

'Program'
     A series of patterns and actions: see below

Input-File

********************

bash
Syntax
      bash [options] [file]

Key
   file   A file containing commands to run, by default bash will read commands from standard input.

  In addition to the single-character shell options documented in the description of the set builtin command,
  bash interprets the following options when it is invoked:

   -c string  Read commands are read from string.
              If there are arguments after string, they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with $0.

   -i         Interactive shell.

   -l         Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell, see INVOCATION below.

   -r         Restricted shell, see RESTRICTED SHELL below.

   -s         Commands are read from the standard input. The default if no file provided.
              This option allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell.

   -D         A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed on the standard output.
              These are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is not C
              or POSIX. This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.

   [-+]O [shopt_option]
              shopt_option is one of the shell options accepted by the shopt builtin.
              If shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O unsets it. If shopt_option is not supplied,
              the names and values of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on the standard output.
              If the invocation option is +O, the output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.

   --         A -- signals the end of options and disables further option processing.
              Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and arguments. An argument of - is equivalent to --.
              Bash also interprets a number of multi-character options. These options must appear on the command line
              before the single-character options to be recognized.

   --debugger  Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts.
              Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin)
              and shell function tracing (see the description of the -o functrace option to the set builtin). 

   --dump-po-strings Equivalent to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (portable object) file format.

   --dump-strings    Equivalent to -D. 

   --help           Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

   --init-file file
   --rcfile file
                    Execute commands from file instead of the standard personal initialization file ~/.bashrc
                    if the shell is interactive, see INVOCATION below.

   --login          Equivalent to -l.

   --noediting      Do not use the GNU readline library to read command lines when the shell is interactive.

   --noprofile      Do not read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile or any of the personal initialization
                    files ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile.
                    By default, bash reads these files when it is invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).

   --norc           Do not read and execute the personal initialization file ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive.
                    This option is on by default if the shell is invoked as sh.
   --posix          Change the behavior of bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to
                    match the standard (posix mode).

   --restricted     Restricted shell, see RESTRICTED SHELL below.

   --rpm-requires   Produce the list of files that are required for the shell script to run.
                    This implies '-n' and is subject to the same limitations as compile time error checking checking;
                    Backticks, [] tests, and evals are not parsed so some dependencies may be missed.

   --verbose        Equivalent to -v.

   --version        Show version information for this instance of bash on the standard output and exit successfully.

      bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq:shell-command 
      bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name or readline-commandKey

   -m keymap    Use keymap as the keymap to be affected by the subsequent bindings.
                Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,
                vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert. vi is equivalent to vi-command;
                emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.

   -p           Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.

   -P           List current readline function names and bindings.

   -x keyseq:shell-command   Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.
                When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the READLINE_LINE variable to the
                contents of the readline line buffer and the READLINE_POINT variable to the current
                location of the insertion point. If the executed command changes the value of
                READLINE_LINE or READLINE_POINT, those new values will be reflected in the editing state.

      bzip2recover filename

Key
   -c --stdout      Compress or decompress to standard output.

   -d --decompress  Force decompression. bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat are really the same program,
                    and the decision about what actions to take is done on the basis of which
                    name is used. This flag overrides that mechanism, and forces bzip2 to decompress.

   -z --compress    The complement to -d: forces compression, regardless of the invokation name.

   -t --test        Check integrity of the specified file(s), but don't decompress them.
                    This really performs a trial decompression and throws away the result.

   -f --force       Force overwrite of output files. Normally, bzip2 will not overwrite existing
                    output files. Also forces bzip2 to break hard links to files, which it otherwise
                    wouldn't do. bzip2 normally declines to decompress files which don't have the
                    correct magic header bytes. If forced (-f), however, it will pass such files
                    through unmodified. This is how GNU gzip behaves.

   -k --keep        Keep (don't delete) input files during compression or decompression.

   -s --small       Reduce memory usage, for compression, decompression and testing. Files are
                    decompressed and tested using a modified algorithm which only requires 2.5 bytes
                    per block byte. This means any file can be decompressed in 2300k of memory, albeit
                    at about half the normal speed. During compression, -s selects a block size of
                    200k, which limits memory use to around the same figure, at the expense of your
                    compression ratio. In short, if your machine is low on memory (8 megabytes or less),
                    use -s for everything.

   -q --quiet       Suppress non-essential warning messages. Messages pertaining to I/O errors and
                    other critical events will not be suppressed.

   -v --verbose     Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio for each file processed. Further -v's
                    increase the verbosity level, spewing out lots of information which is primarily
                    of interest for diagnostic purposes.

   -L --license
   -V --version     Display the software version, license terms and conditions.

   -1 (or --fast) to -9 (or -best)
                    Set the block size to 100 k, 200 k ... 900 k when compressing. Has no effect when
                    decompressing. The --fast and --best aliases are primarily for GNU gzip
                    compatibility. In particular, --fast doesn't make things significantly faster.
                    And --best merely selects the default behaviour.

   --               Treats all subsequent arguments as file names, even if they start with a dash.
                    This is so you can handle files with names beginning with a dash,
                    for example: bzip2 -- -myfilename.

   --repetitive-fast, --repetitive-best
                    These flags are redundant in versions 0.9.5 and above. They provided some coarse
                    control over the behaviour of the sorting algorithm in earlier versions, bzip now
                    has an improved algorithm which renders these flags irrelevant.

chown
SYNTAX
      chown [Options]... NewOwner File...

      chown [Options]... :Group File...

      chown [Options]... --reference=RFILE File...

   If used, NewOwner specifies the new owner and/or group as follows
   (with no embedded white space):

     [OWNER] [ [:.] [GROUP] ]

   Some examples of how the owner/group can be specified:

     OWNER
     If only an OWNER (a user name or numeric user id) is given, that
     user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group is
     not changed.

     OWNER.GROUP
     OWNER:GROUP
     If the OWNER is followed by a colon or dot and a GROUP (a group
     name or numeric group id), with no spaces between them, the group
     ownership of the files is changed as well (to GROUP).

     OWNER.
     OWNER:
     If a colon or dot but no group name follows OWNER, that user is
     made the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed
     to OWNER's login group.

     .GROUP
     :GROUP
     If the colon or dot and following GROUP are given, but the owner
     is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case,
     'chown' performs the same function as 'chgrp'.

OPTIONS:

   -c
   --changes
       Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose ownership actually changes.

   --dereference
       Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on what they point to.

   -f
   --silent
   --quiet
       Do not print error messages about files whose ownership cannot be changed.
    

   -h
   --no-dereference
       Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to.
       This is the default.  This mode relies on the 'lchown' system call.
       On systems that do not provide the 'lchown' system call, 'chown'
       fails when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link.
       By default, no diagnostic is issued for symbolic links encountered
       during a recursive traversal, but see '--verbose'.

   --reference=FILE
       Use the user and group of the reference FILE instead of an explicit
       NewOwner value.

   -R
   --recursive
       Recursively change ownership of directories and their contents. 
       Take care to not run recursive chown on the root '/' directory or any other system directory.

   -v
   --verbose
       Verbosely describe the action (or non-action) taken for every FILE.
       If a symbolic link is encountered during a recursive traversal on a system without
       the 'lchown' system call, and '--no-dereference' is in effect, then issue a
       diagnostic saying neither the symbolic link nor its referent is being changed.

chpasswd
SYNTAX
      chpasswd [Options...]

OPTIONS
   -c, --crypt-method METHOD
      Use the specified method to encrypt the passwords.

       The available methods are DES, MD5, NONE, and SHA256 or SHA512 if
       your libc support these methods.

       By default, PAM is used to encrypt the passwords.

   -e, --encrypted
       Supplied passwords are in encrypted form.

   -h, --help
       Display help message and exit.

   -m, --md5
       Use MD5 encryption instead of DES when the supplied passwords are
       not encrypted.

   -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
       Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the
       configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory.

   -s, --sha-rounds ROUNDS
       Use the specified number of rounds to encrypt the passwords.

       The value 0 means that the system will choose the default number
       of rounds for the crypt method (5000).

       A minimal value of 1000 and a maximal value of 999,999,999 will
       be enforced.

       You can only use this option with the SHA256 or SHA512 crypt
       method.

       By default, the number of rounds is defined by the
       SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS variables in
       /etc/login.defs.

Options:
   --level levels
             The run levels an operation should pertain to.
             Given as a string of numbers from 0 to 7.
             For example, --level 35 specifies runlevels 3 and 5. 

   --add name
             Add a new service for management by chkconfig.
             When a new service is added, chkconfig ensures that the
             service has either a start or a kill entry in every runlevel.
             If any runlevel is missing such an entry, chkconfig creates
             the appropriate entry as specified by the default values in
             the init script. Note that default entries in LSB-delimited
             'INIT INFO' sections take precedence over the default runlevels
             in the initscript. 
   --del name
             Delete the service from chkconfig management, and remove any 
             links in /etc/rc[0-6].d which pertain to it.

             Note that future package installs for this service may
             run chkconfig --add, which will re-add such links.
             To disable a service, run chkconfig name off. 

   --list name
             List all of the services which chkconfig knows about, and
             whether they are stopped or started in each runlevel.
             If name is specified, information is only displayed about service name.

               [--version] destination-directory < name-list

   The first option to cpio is a mode indicator:

      -i    Copy-in mode.  Read an archive from standard input (unless overriden) and extract the contents to disk
            or (if the -t option is specified) list the contents to standard output.
            If one or more file patterns are specified, only files matching one of the patterns will be extracted.

            Unlike in the shell, an initial '.' in a filename does match a wildcard at the start of a pattern, and
            a '/' in a filename can match wildcards.

      -o    Copy-out mode.  Read a list of filenames, one per line, from standard input and produce a new archive on standard output
            (unless overriden) containing the specified items.

      -p    Pass-Thru mode.  Read a list of filenames from standard input and copy the files to the specified directory.
            This combines the copy-out and copy-in steps without actually using an archive.
Options:

   Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable in all operating modes.

   -0, --null
       Read filenames separated by NUL characters instead of newlines. (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)
       This is necessary if any of the filenames being read might contain newlines.
       GNU find is one way to produce a list of null-terminated filenames.

   -a, --reset-access-time
       Reset the access times of files after reading them, so that it does not look like they have just been read.
       (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)

   -A, --append
       Append to an existing archive. (Only works in copy-out mode.)
       The archive must be a disk file specified with the -O or -F (-file) option.

   -b, --swap
       Swap both halfwords of words and bytes of halfwords in the data. Equivalent to -sS.
       (may be used in copy-in mode.)
       Use this option to convert 32-bit integers between big-endian and little-endian machines. 

   -B
       Set the I/O block size to 5120 bytes. Initially the block size is 512 bytes. (copy-out mode only)

   --block-size=BLOCK-SIZE
       Set the I/O block size to BLOCK-SIZE * 512 bytes.

   -c  Identical to '-H newc', use the new (SVR4 ) portable format. (copy-out mode only)
       If you wish the old portable (ASCII ) archive format, use '-H odc' instead.

   -C IO-SIZE, --io-size=IO-SIZE
       Set the I/O block size to IO-SIZE bytes. (copy-out mode only.)

   -d, --make-directories
       Create leading directories where needed. (copy-in and pass-thru modes.)

   -E FILE, --pattern-file=FILE
       Read additional patterns specifying filenames to extract or list from FILE. (copy-in mode only.)
       The lines of FILE are treated as if they had been non-option arguments to cpio. This option is used in copy-in mode, 

   -f, --nonmatching
       Only copy files that do not match any of the given patterns. 

   -F, --file=archive
       Archive filename to use instead of standard input or output. (copy-in mode only.)
       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with 'HOSTNAME: '.
       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have
       permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts' file). 

   --force-local
       With -F, -I, or -O, take the archive file name to be a local file even if it contains a colon, which would
       ordinarily indicate a remote host name.

   -H FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
       Use archive format FORMAT. The valid formats are listed below; the same names are also recognized in all-caps.
       The default in copy-in mode is to automatically detect the archive format, and in copy-out mode is 'bin'.

          'bin'    The obsolete binary format. 
          'odc'    The old (POSIX .1) portable format. 
          'newc'   The new (SVR4 ) portable format, which supports file systems having more than 65536 i-nodes. 
          'crc'    The new (SVR4 ) portable format with a checksum added. 
          'tar'    The old tar format. 
          'ustar'  The POSIX .1 tar format. Also recognizes GNU tar archives, which are similar but not identical. 
          'hpbin'  The obsolete binary format used by HPUX 's cpio (which stores device files differently). 
          'hpodc'  The portable format used by HPUX 's cpio (which stores device files differently). 

   -i, --extract
       Run in copy-in mode. see 'Copy-in mode'. 

   -I archive
       Archive filename to use instead of standard input.
       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with 'HOSTNAME: '.
       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you
       have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts' file). 

   -k
       Ignored; for compatibility with other versions of cpio.

   -l, --link
       Link files instead of copying them, when possible.  (pass-thru mode only.)

   -L, --dereference
       Copy the file that a symbolic link points to, rather than the symbolic link itself.  (copy-out and pass-thru modes.)

   -m, --preserve-modification-time
       Retain previous file modification times when creating files. (copy-in and pass-thru modes.)

   -M MESSAGE, --message=MESSAGE
       Print MESSAGE when the end of a volume of the backup media (such as a tape or a floppy disk) is reached, to
       prompt the user to insert a new volume. (copy-in and copy-out modes.)
       If MESSAGE contains the string '%d', it is replaced by the current volume number (starting at 1). 

   -n, --numeric-uid-gid
       Show numeric UID and GID instead of translating them into names when using the '--verbose option'.
       (i mode, only with -t)

   --no-absolute-filenames
       Create all files relative to the current directory in copy-in mode, even if they have an absolute file name in the archive.

   --absolute-filenames' (default)
       Do not strip leading file name components that contain '..' and leading slashes from file names in copy-in mode 

   --no-preserve-owner
       Do not change the ownership of the files; leave them owned by the user extracting them.
       This is the default for non-root users, so that users on System V don't inadvertently give away files.
       (This option can be used in copy-in mode and copy-pass mode.)

   -o, --create
       Run in copy-out mode. see 'Copy-out mode'. 

   -O archive
       Archive filename to use instead of standard output. (Copy-out mode only)
       To use a tape drive on another machine as the archive, use a filename that starts with 'HOSTNAME: '.
       The hostname can be preceded by a username and an '@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you
       have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's '~/.rhosts' file). 

   --only-verify-crc
       Verify the CRC 's of each file in the archive, when reading a CRC format archive.
       Don't actually extract the files. 

   -p, --pass-through
       Run in copy-pass mode. see 'Copy-pass mode'. 

   --quiet
       Do not print the number of blocks copied.

   -r, --rename
       Interactively rename files. 

   -R [user][:.][group], --owner [user][:.][group]
       Set the ownership of all files created to the specified user and/or group in copy-out and copy-pass modes.
       Either the user, the group, or both, must be present. If the group is omitted but the ':' or '.' separator is
       given, use the given user's login group. Only the super-user can change files' ownership. 

   --rsh-command=COMMAND
       Notifies cpio that is should use COMMAND to communicate with remote devices. 

   -s, --swap-bytes
       Swap the bytes of each halfword (pair of bytes) in the files. (copy-in mode.)

   -S, --swap-halfwords
       Swap the halfwords of each word (4 bytes) in the files. (copy-in mode.)

   --sparse
       Write files with large blocks of zeros as sparse files. (copy-in and copy-pass modes.)

   -t, --list
       Print a table of contents of the input. (Copy-in mode only.)

   --to-stdout
       Extract files to standard output. (copy-in mode.)

   -u, --unconditional
       Replace all files, without asking whether to replace existing newer files with older files.
       (copy-in and copy-pass modes.)

   -v, --verbose
       List the files processed, or with '-t', give an 'ls -l' style table of contents listing.
       In a verbose table of contents of a ustar archive, user and group names in the archive that do not exist
       on the local system are replaced by the names that correspond locally to the numeric UID and GID stored in the archive. 

   -V, --dot
       Print a '.' for each file processed. 

   --version
       Print the cpio program version number and exit.

EXIT STATUS
   The cpio utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.ls | cpio -ov > directory.cpiofind src | cpio -pmud destfind . -print -depth | cpio -ov > tree.cpiocpio -idv < tree.cpiofind src -mtime +2 | xargs grep -l foobar | cpio -pdmu destfind src -mtime +2 | grep foo[bar] | cpio -pdmu dest

cron
Syntax
      cron [-n | -p | -s | -m<mailcommand>]

      cron -x [ext,sch,proc,pars,load,misc,test,bit] 

Key
   -s  This option will direct cron to send job output to the system log using syslog(3).
       This is useful if your system has no sendmail(8), or if mail is disabled using -m off.

   -m  This option allows you to specify a shell command string to use for sending cron
       mail output instead of sendmail(8). This command must accept a fully formatted mail
       message (with headers) on stdin and send it as a mail message to the recipients
       specified in the mail headers.

   -n  This option changes default behavior causing it to run crond in the foreground.
       This can be useful when starting it out of init.

   -p  Permit any crontab, which user set.

   -x  This option sets debug flags.

   As a special case, the string off will disable sending mail.

   -r  Remove the current crontab.

   -e  Edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the 
       VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.

csplit
Syntax
     csplit [options]... FILE PATTERN...Options

   -f PREFIX
   --prefix=PREFIX
       Use PREFIX as the output file name prefix.

   -b SUFFIX
   --suffix=SUFFIX
       Use SUFFIX as the output file name suffix.  When this option is
       specified, the suffix string must include exactly one
       'printf(3)'-style conversion specification, possibly including
       format specification flags, a field width, a precision
       specifications, or all of these kinds of modifiers.  The format
       letter must convert a binary integer argument to readable form;
       thus, only 'd', 'i', 'u', 'o', 'x', and 'X' conversions are
       allowed.  The entire SUFFIX is given (with the current output file
       number) to 'sprintf(3)' to form the file name suffixes for each of
       the individual output files in turn.  If this option is used, the
       '--digits' option is ignored.

   -n DIGITS
   --digits=DIGITS
       Use output file names containing numbers that are DIGITS digits
       long instead of the default 2.

   -k
   --keep-files
       Do not remove output files when errors are encountered.

   -z
   --elide-empty-files
       Suppress the generation of zero-length output files.  (In cases
       where the section delimiters of the input file are supposed to
       mark the first lines of each of the sections, the first output
       file will generally be a zero-length file unless you use this
       option.)  The output file sequence numbers always run
       consecutively starting from 0, even when this option is specified.

   -s
   -q
   --silent
   --quiet
       Do not print counts of output file sizes.N
      Create an output file containing the input up to but not including
      line N (a positive integer).  If followed by a repeat count, also
      create an output file containing the next LINE lines of the input
      file once for each repeat.

   /REGEXP/[OFFSET]
      Create an output file containing the current line up to (but not
      including) the next line of the input file that contains a match
      for REGEXP.  The optional OFFSET is a '+' or '-' followed by a
      positive integer.  If it is given, the input up to the matching
      line plus or minus OFFSET is put into the output file, and the
      line after that begins the next section of input.

   %REGEXP%[OFFSET]
      Like the previous type, except that it does not create an output
      file, so that section of the input file is effectively ignored.

   {REPEAT-COUNT}
      Repeat the previous pattern REPEAT-COUNT additional times.
      REPEAT-COUNT can either be a positive integer or an asterisk,
      meaning repeat as many times as necessary until the input is
      exhausted.

********************

curl
Syntax 
      curl [options] [URL...]

Key
   url  One or multiple URLs that will be fetched in sequence.

        Multiple URLs or parts of URLs can be specified by writing part sets within braces as in:

        https://site.{one,two,three}.com

        or get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt (with leading zeros)
        ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

   -A "agent string"
   --user-agent "agent string"
        Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
        To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
        quote marks. This can also be set with -H, --header option. (HTTP)

   -b name=data
   --cookie name=data
        Send the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data
        previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line.
        The data should be in the format  "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2".

   -c filename
   --cookie-jar file name
        Save cookies to file after a completed operation.
        Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified file
        as well as all cookies received from remote server(s).
        If no cookies are known, no file will be written.
        TO write to stdout, set the file name to a single dash,  "-"

   --compressed
          Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
        curl supports (gzip), and save  the  uncompressed  document.
        If this option  is  used  and  the server sends an unsupported encoding,
        curl will report an error.(HTTP)

   -d @file
   -d "string"
   --data "string"
        Send the specified data in an (HTTP) POST request, in the same way that a
        web browser does.
        This  will pass the data using the content-type
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.

        -d, --data is the same as  --data-ascii.  To post data in pure binary, use --data-binary.
        To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

        Multiple date options will be merged together.
        Thus,  using  '-d  name=daniel  -d skill=lousy' would generate a post
        that looks like  'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.

        If the data starts with @, the rest should be a filename containing the data.
   
   -F name=@file
   -F name=content
     --form name=content
        Emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button.
        This will POST data using the Content-Type  multipart/form-data according
        to  RFC 2388.  This enables uploading of binary files etc.

        If the data starts with @, the rest should be a filename.
        To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the
        symbol <. The difference between @ and <  is that  @  makes a file get
        attached in the post as a file upload, while the < makes a text field
        and gets the contents for that text field from a file.

        Example, to send your password file to the server, where 'password' is
        the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the input:

        curl -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com

   -k
   --insecure
        This option explicitly allows curl to  perform  "insecure" SSL connections
        and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted in secure mode using the
        CA certificate  bundle  installed by  default. This  makes  all connections
        considered "insecure" fail unless -k, --insecure is used.(SSL)

   --limit-rate speed
        Specify the maximum transfer rate.  This feature is useful if you have a
        limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire bandwidth.

        The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is appended.
        Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes/sec, 'm' or M' megabytes,
        while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes/sec. Eg: 200K, 3m, 1G.

   -m seconds
   --max-time seconds
        Maximum time that you allow the whole operation to take.
        This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from  hanging for hours due to
        slow networks or links going down.  See also the --connect-timeout option.

   -o file
   --output file
        Write output to file instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch
        multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number  in  the file specifier.
        That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched.
        Like in:
                 curl https://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"
        or use several variables like:
                 curl https://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"
        You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.

        See also --create-dirs option to create the local directories dynamically.
        Specify '-' to force the output to stdout.   

   -O
   --remote-name
        Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get.
        (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)
        The  remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing else.
        Consequentially, the file will be saved in the  current  working directory.

   -s
   --silent
        Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages.
   
   --trace-ascii file
        Enable a full trace dump of all  incoming  and  outgoing  data, including
        descriptive information, to the given output file.
        Use "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.
        This option overrides previous uses of -v, --verbose or --trace-ascii.
        If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

   -T file
     --upload-file file
        Transfer the specified local file to the remote  URL.  PUT
        If there is no file part in the specified URL, Curl will append the local
        file name. You must use a trailing / on the last directory to really prove
        to Curl that there is no file name or curl will think that the last
        directory name is the remote file name to use.
        Use the file name "-" to use stdin

        You can specify one -T for each URL on the command line. Each -T
        + URL pair specifies what to upload and to where. curl also supports "globbing"
        of the -T argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a single URL
        like this:

        curl -T "{file1,file2}" https://www.uploadtothissite.com
        or even
        curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/

   -I
   --head
        Fetch the HTTP-header only! (HTTP/FTP/FILE) 
        HTTP-servers feature the  command  HEAD which this uses to get nothing but
        the header of a document. When used on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays
        the file size and last modification time only.

   -u user:password
   --user user:password
        The username and password to use for server authentication.
        Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.

        If you just give the user name (without entering a  colon) curl will prompt
        for a password.

        If you use an SSPI-enabled curl binary and do NTLM authentication, you can
        force curl to pick up the username and password from your environment by
        specifying a single colon with this option: "-u :".

        If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

   -w
   --write-out format
        Define extra info to display on stdout after a completed and successful operation.
        The format is a string that may contain plain text mixed with any
        number of variables. The format string can be specified  as "string", or to
        read from a file specify  "@filename" 
        to read the format from stdin use "@-".

        Various variables may be included in the format and will be substituted by
        curl (file size, ip address etc see man curl for details).
        variables are specified as %{variable_name} 

        Output a newline using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

   -x host:port
   -x  [protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]
   --proxy [protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]
        Use the  specified HTTP proxy.
        If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080.


   -H "name: value"
   --header "name: value"
        Add Header when getting a web page.
        You may specify any number of extra headers.

   -H "name:"
   --header "name:"
        Remove Header, remove an internal header.

   -L
   --location
        Follow redirects if the server reports that the requested page has moved
        (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code)

   -v
   --verbose
        Make more verbose/talkative. Mostly useful for debugging.

dc
Syntax
      dc options

Options

   -e EXPR
   --expression=EXPR
        Evaluate EXPR as DC commands.

   -f FILE
   --file=FILE
        Read and evaluate DC commands from FILE.

   -h
   --help
        Print a usage message summarizing the command-line options, then exit.

   -V
   --version
        Print the version information for this program, then exit.

To exit, use 'q' or 'quit'.p   Print the value on the top of the stack, without altering the stack. A newline is printed after the value.

   n   Print the value on the top of the stack, popping it off, and does not print a newline after.

   P   Pop off the value on top of the stack.
       If it it a string, it is simply printed without a trailing newline.
       Otherwise it is a number, and the integer portion of its absolute value is printed out as a "base (UCHAR_MAX+1)" byte stream.

       Assuming that (UCHAR_MAX+1) is 256 (as it is on most machines with 8-bit bytes),
       the sequence KSK0k1/_1Ss [ls*]Sxd0>x [256~Ssd0<x]dsxxsx[q]Sq[Lsd0>qaPlxx] dsxxsx0sqLqsxLxLK+k could also accomplish
       this function. (Much of the complexity of the above native-dc code is due to the ~ computing the characters backwards,
       and the desire to ensure that all registers wind up back in their original states.)

   f   Print the entire contents of the stack without altering anything.
       This is a good command to use if you are lost or want to figure out what the effect of some command has been.so entering:
   100   0.5   *   p
   will return 50+   Pop two values off the stack, add them, and push the result.
       The precision of the result is determined only by the values of the arguments, and is enough to be exact.

   -   Pop two values, subtract the first one popped from the second, and push the result.

   *   Pop two values, multiply them, and push the result.
       The number of fraction digits in the result depends on the current precision value and the number of
       fraction digits in the two arguments.

   /   Pop two values, divides the second one popped from the first one popped, and push the result.
       The number of fraction digits is specified by the precision value.

   %   Pop two values, computes the remainder of the division that the / command would do, and push that.
       The value computed is the same as that computed by the sequence Sd dld/ Ld*- .

   ~   Pop two values, divid the second one popped from the first.
       The quotient is pushed first, and the remainder is pushed next.
       The number of fraction digits used in the division is specified by the precision value.
      (The sequence SdSn lnld/ LnLd% could also accomplish this function, with slightly different error checking.)

   ^   Pop two values and exponentiates, using the first value popped as the exponent and the second popped as the base.
       The fraction part of the exponent is ignored. The precision value is the number of fraction digits in the result.

   |   Pop three values and compute a modular exponentiation.
       The first value popped is used as the reduction modulus; this value must be a non-zero number, and should be an integer.
       The second popped is used as the exponent; this value must be a non-negative number, and any fractional part of this
       exponent will be ignored.
       The third value popped is the base which gets exponentiated, which should be an integer. For small integers this is
       like the sequence Sm^Lm%, but, unlike ^, this command will work with arbitrarily large exponents.

   v   Pop one value, compute its square root, and push that. The precision value specifies the number of fraction digits in
       the result. Most arithmetic operations are affected by the 'precision value', which you can set with the k command.
       The default precision value is zero, which means that all arithmetic except for addition and subtraction produces
       integer results.c   Clear the stack, rendering it empty.

   d   Duplicate the value on the top of the stack, pushing another copy of it. Thus, '4d*p' computes 4 squared and prints it.

   r   Reverse the order of (swaps) the top two values on the stack. (This can also be accomplished with the sequence SaSbLaLb.)sr   Pop the value off the top of the stack and store it into register r.

   lr   Copy the value in register r and push it onto the stack. This does not alter the contents of r.
        Each register also contains its own stack. The current register value is the top of the register's stack.

   Sr   Pop the value off the top of the (main) stack and push it onto the stack of register r.
        The previous value of the register becomes inaccessible.

   Lr   Pop the value off the top of register r's stack and push it onto the main stack.
        The previous value in register r's stack, if any, is now accessible via the lr command.i   Pop a value off the top of the stack and use it to set the input radix.

   o   Pop a value off the top of the stack and use it to set the output radix.

   k   Pop a value off the top of the stack and use it to set the precision.

   I   Push the current input radix on the stack.

   O   Push the current output radix on the stack.

   K   Push the current precision on the stack.[characters]  Make a string containing characters (contained between balanced [ and ] characters), and
       push it on the stack.
       For example, [foo]P prints the characters foo (with no newline).  a The top-of-stack is popped.
       If it was a number, then the low-order byte of this number is converted into a string and pushed
       onto the stack. Otherwise the top-of-stack was a string, and the first character of that string is
       pushed back.

   x   Pop a value off the stack and executes it as a macro. Normally it should be a string; if it is a
       number, it is simply pushed back onto the stack.
       For example, [1p]x executes the macro 1p which pushes 1 on the stack and prints 1 on a separate line.
       Macros are most often stored in registers; [1p]sa stores a macro to print 1 into register a,
       and lax invokes this macro.

   >r  Pop two values off the stack and compare them assuming they are numbers, executing the contents
       of register r as a macro if the original top-of-stack is greater.
       Thus, 1 2>a will invoke register a's contents and 2 1>a will not.

  !>r  Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is not greater than (less than or equal to)
       what was the second-to-top.

   <r  Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is less.

  !<r  Similar but invokes the macro if the original top-of-stack is not less than (greater than or equal to)
       what was the second-to-top.

   =r  Similar but invokes the macro if the two numbers popped are equal.

  !=r  Similar but invokes the macro if the two numbers popped are not equal.

   ?   Reads a line from the terminal and executes it. This command allows a macro to request input from the user.

   q   exit from a macro and also from the macro which invoked it.
       If called from the top level, or from a macro which was called directly from the top level, the q command
       will cause dc to exit.

   Q   Pop a value off the stack and uses it as a count of levels of macro execution to be exited.
       Thus, 3Q exits three levels. The Q command will never cause dc to exit.Z   Pop a value off the stack, calculate the number of digits it has (or number of characters, if it is a string)
       and push that number. The digit count for a number does not include any leading zeros, even if those
       appear to the right of the radix point.

   X   Pop a value off the stack, calculate the number of fraction digits it has, and push that number.
       For a string, the value pushed is 0.

   z   Push the current stack depth: the number of objects on the stack before the execution of the z command.!   Will run the rest of the line as a system command.
       Note that parsing of the !<, !=, and !> commands take precedence, so if you want to run a command starting
       with <, =, or > you will need to add a space after the !.

   #   Will interpret the rest of the line as a comment.

   :r  Will pop the top two values off of the stack.
       The old second-to-top value will be stored in the array r, indexed by the old top-of-stack value.

   ;r  Pop the top-of-stack and uses it as an index into the array r.
       The selected value is then pushed onto the stack. Note that each stacked instance of a register has its own array
       associated with it. Thus 1 0:a 0Sa 2 0:a La 0;ap will print 1,
       because the 2 was stored in an instance of 0:a that was later popped.

dd
Syntax
     dd [Options]

Key
   if=FILE
      Input file : Read from FILE instead of standard input.

   of=FILE
      Output file : Write to FILE instead of standard output.  Unless 'conv=notrunc'
      is given, 'dd' truncates FILE to zero bytes (or the size specified
      with 'seek=').

   ibs=BYTES
      Read BYTES bytes at a time.

   obs=BYTES
      Write BYTES bytes at a time.

   bs=BYTES
      Block size, both read and write BYTES bytes at a time.  This overrides 'ibs'
      and 'obs'.

   cbs=BYTES
      Convert BYTES bytes at a time.

   skip=BLOCKS
      Skip BLOCKS 'ibs'-byte blocks in the input file before copying.

   seek=BLOCKS
      Skip BLOCKS 'obs'-byte blocks in the output file before copying.

   count=BLOCKS
      Copy BLOCKS 'ibs'-byte blocks from the input file, instead of
      everything until the end of the file.

   conv=CONVERSION[,CONVERSION]...
      Convert the file as specified by the CONVERSION argument(s).  
      (No spaces around any comma)

     Conversions:
    'ascii'    Convert EBCDIC to ASCII.
    'ebcdic'   Convert ASCII to EBCDIC.
    'ibm'      Convert ASCII to alternate EBCDIC.
    'block'    For each line in the input, output 'cbs' bytes, replacing the
               input newline with a space and padding with spaces as
               necessary.
    'unblock'  Replace trailing spaces in each 'cbs'-sized input block with a newline.
    'lcase'    Change uppercase letters to lowercase.
    'ucase'    Change lowercase letters to uppercase.
    'swab'     Swap every pair of input bytes.  GNU 'dd', unlike others, works when
               an odd number of bytes are read--the last byte is copied
               (since there is nothing to swap it with).
    'noerror'  Continue after read errors.
    'notrunc'  Do not truncate the output file.
    'sync'     Pad every input block to size of 'ibs' with trailing zero bytes.

declare
SYNTAX
      declare [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value]]

Key
   -a   Each name is an array variable.

   -A   Each name is an associative array variable

   -f   Use function names only.

   -F   Inhibit the display of function definitions; 
        only the function name and attributes are printed. (implies -f)

   -g   Force variables to be created or modified at the global scope, even when declare is executed
        in a shell function. It is ignored in all other cases. 

   -i   The variable is to be treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see Shell Arithmetic)
        is performed when the variable is assigned a value.

   -I   Cause local variables to inherit the attributes (except the nameref attribute) and value
        of any existing variable with the same name at a surrounding scope.
        If there is no existing variable, the local variable is initially unset. 

   -l   When the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case characters are
        converted to lower-case. The upper-case attribute is disabled.

   -n   Give each name the nameref attribute, making it a name reference to another variable.
        That other variable is defined by the value of name.
        All references, assignments, and attribute modifications to name, except for those using
        or changing the -n attribute itself, are performed on the variable referenced by name’s value.
        The nameref attribute cannot be applied to array variables.

   -p   Display the attributes and values of each name. 
        When -p is used with name arguments, additional options, other than -f and -F, are ignored.
        When -p is supplied without name arguments, declare will display the attributes and values
        of all variables having the attributes specified by the additional options.
        If no other options are supplied with -p, declare will display the attributes and values
        of all shell variables. The -f option will restrict the display to shell functions. 

   -r   Make names readonly. 
        These names cannot then be assigned values by subsequent assignment statements 
        or unset.

   -t   Give each name the trace attribute.
        Traced functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps from the calling shell.
        The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.

   -u   When the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.
        The lower-case attribute is disabled.

   -x   Mark each name for export to subsequent commands via the environment.

     special-purpose pseudo-filesystems, such as automounter entries.
     Also, filesystems of type "ignore" or "auto", supported by some
     operating systems, are only included if this option is specified.

 -h
 --human-readable
     Append a size letter such as 'M' for megabytes to each size.
     Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; 'M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.
     Use the '-H' or '--si' option if you prefer powers of 1000.

 -H
 --si
     Append a size letter such as 'M' for megabytes to each size.  (SI
     is the International System of Units, which defines these letters
     as prefixes.)  Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; 'M' stands for
     1,000,000 bytes.  Use the '-h' or '--human-readable' option if you
     prefer powers of 1024.

 -i
 --inodes
     List inode usage information instead of block usage.  An inode
     (short for index node) is contains information about a file such
     as its owner, permissions, timestamps, and location on the disk.

 -k
 --kilobytes
     Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size.

 -l
 --local
     Limit the listing to local filesystems.  By default, remote
     filesystems are also listed.

 -m
 --megabytes
     Print sizes in megabyte (that is, 1,048,576-byte) blocks.

 --no-sync
     Do not invoke the 'sync' system call before getting any usage data.
     This can make 'df' run significantly faster on systems with many
     disks, but on some systems (notably SunOS) the results can be
     slightly out of date.  This is the default.

 -P
 --portability
     Use the POSIX output format.  This is like the default format
     except that the information about each filesystem is always
     printed on exactly one line; a mount device is never put on a line
     by itself.  This means that if the mount device name is more than
     20 characters long (e.g., for some network mounts), the columns
     are misaligned.

 --sync
     Invoke the 'sync' system call before getting any usage data.  On
     some systems (notably SunOS), doing this yields more up to date
     results, but in general this option makes 'df' much slower,
     especially when there are many or very busy filesystems.

 -t FSTYPE
 --type=FSTYPE
     Limit the listing to filesystems of type FSTYPE.  Multiple
     filesystem types can be specified by giving multiple '-t' options.
     By default, nothing is omitted.

 -T
 --print-type
     Print each filesystem's type.  The types printed here are the same
     ones you can include or exclude with '-t' and '-x'.  The particular
     types printed are whatever is supported by the system.  Here are
     some of the common names (this list is certainly not exhaustive):

    'nfs'
          An NFS filesystem, i.e., one mounted over a network from
          another machine.  This is the one type name which seems to be
          used uniformly by all systems.

    '4.2, ufs, efs...'
          A filesystem on a locally-mounted hard disk.  (The system
          might even support more than one type here; Linux does.)

    'hsfs, cdfs'
          A filesystem on a CD-ROM drive.  HP-UX uses 'cdfs', most other
          systems use 'hsfs' ('hs' for 'High Sierra').

    'pcfs'
          An MS-DOS filesystem, usually on a diskette.

 -x FSTYPE
 --exclude-type=FSTYPE
     Limit the listing to filesystems not of type FSTYPE.  Multiple
     filesystem types can be eliminated by giving multiple '-x'
     options.  By default, no filesystem types are omitted.

 -v
     Ignored; for compatibility with System V versions of 'df'.

diff3
Syntax
      diff3 [options] MYFILE OLDFILE YOURFILE

Options

   -a --text
         Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they  do not appear to be text.

   -A --show-all
         Output all changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, surrounding all conflicts with bracket lines.

   -e --ed
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE.

   -E --show-overlap
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, bracketing conflicts. 

   -x --overlap-only
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, output only overlapping changes.

   -X
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, output only overlapping changes, bracketing them.

   -3 --easy-only
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, Output only nonoverlapping changes. 

   -m --merge
         Output merged file instead of ed script (default -A).
         Unlike piping the output from 'diff3' to 'ed', this works even for binary files and incomplete lines.

   -L LABEL --label=LABEL
         Use LABEL instead of file name.
         Use the label LABEL for the brackets output by the '-A', '-E' and '-X' options.
         This option can be given up to three times, one for each input file.
         The default labels are the names of the input files.

         Thus 'diff3 -L X -L Y -L Z -m A B C' acts like 'diff3 -m A B C', except that the
         output looks like it came from files named 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' rather than from files named 'A', 'B' and 'C'.

   -i
         Append 'w' and 'q' commands at the end of ed scripts.
         This option must be combined with one of the '-AeExX3' options, and can not be combined with '-m'.

   -T --initial-tab
         Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text of a line in normal format.

   --diff-program=PROGRAM
         Use PROGRAM to compare files.

   --strip-trailing-cr
         strip trailing carriage return on input.

   -v --version
         Output the version number of 'diff3'.

   --help
         Output this help.

dig (domain information groper)
Syntax:
     dig [@server] [-b address] [-c class] [-f filename] [-k filename]
             [-p port#] [-t type] [-x addr] [-y name:key] [-4] [-6]
                [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]     dig [-h]
     dig [global-queryopt...] [query...]

Options:

   -b address
         Set the source IP address of the query to address.
         This must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces or "0.0.0.0" or "::".
         An optional port can be specified by appending "#"

   -c class
         Over-ride the default query class (IN for internet).
         class is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH for CHAOSNET records.

   -f filename 
         Operate in batch mode by reading a list of lookup requests to process from a file.
         The file contains a number of queries, one per line.
         Each entry in the file should be organised in the same way they would be presented
         as queries to dig using the command-line interface.

   -p port#
        Specify a non-standard port number to be queried,
        default = the standard DNS port number 53.
        This option would be used to test a name server that has been configured
        to listen for queries on a non-standard port number.

   -4   Force dig to only use IPv4 query transport.

   -6   Force dig to only use IPv6 query transport.

   -t type
        Set the query type to type, any valid query type which is supported in BIND9.
        The default query type "A", unless the -x option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup.
        A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR.

        When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, type is set to ixfr=N.
        The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the
        serial number in the zone's SOA record was N.

   -x addr
        Reverse lookups - mapping addresses to names: addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-
        decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used, there is no need
        to provide the name, class and type arguments.
        dig automatically performs a lookup for a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type
        and class to PTR and IN respectively.
        By default, IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. To use the older RFC1886
        method using the IP6.INT domain specify the -i option.
        Bit string labels (RFC2874) are now experimental and are not attempted.

   -k filename
        Sign the DNS queries sent by dig and their responses using transaction signatures (TSIG key file).
        You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line using the -y option;
        name is the name of the TSIG key and key is the actual key.
        The key is a base-64 encoded string, typically generated by dnssec-keygen(8).

        Caution should be taken when using the -y option on multi-user systems as the key can be visible in the
        output from ps(1) or in the shell's history file.
        When using TSIG authentication with dig, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and
        algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate key and server statements
        in named.conf.

   -h   Print a brief summary of the command-line arguments and options.

 -p
 --print-database
     Print the (compiled-in) default color configuration database.  This
     output is itself a valid configuration file, and is fairly
     descriptive of the possibilities.

********************

dirs
Syntax
      dirs [+N | -N] [-clpv]

Options
     +N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the left of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero. 

     -N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the right of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero.  

     -c   Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the elements. 

     -l   Produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote 
          the home directory.

     -p   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line. 
     -v   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.

********************

dos2unix
Syntax
      dos2unix [options] [-c convmode] [-o file ...] [-n infile outfile ...]

Key
   -h --help        Print online help. 
   -k --keepdate    Keep the date stamp of output file same as input file. 
   -q --quiet       Quiet mode. Suppress all warning and messages.
   -V --version     Prints version information.

   -c --convmode convmode
                    Set conversion mode.
                    Where convmode is one of: ASCII, 7bit, ISO, Mac with ASCII being the default.
                    Simulates dos2unix under SunOS.

   -o --oldfile file ...
                    Old file mode.
                    Convert the file and write output to it. The program defaults to run in this mode.
                    Wildcard names may be used.

   -n --newfile infile outfile ...
                    New file mode. Convert the infile and write output to outfile.
                    File names must be given in pairs and wildcard names should NOT be used or you WILL lose your files.

********************

dmesg
Syntax
      dmesg [ -c ] [ -n level ] [ -s bufsize ]Options-c          Clear the ring buffer contents after printing.

   -s bufsize  Use a buffer of size bufsize to query the kernel ring buffer.
               This is 16392 by default. (The default kernel syslog buffer 
               size was 4096 at first, 8192 since 1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.)
               If you have set the kernel buffer to be larger than the default
               then this option can be used to view the entire buffer. 

   -n level    Set the level at which logging of messages is done to the console.
               For example, -n 1 prevents all messages, expect panic messages,
               from appearing on the console. All levels of messages are still
               written to /proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8) can still be used to control exactly
               where kernel messages appear. When the -n option is used, dmesg will not
               print or clear the kernel ring buffer.

********************

dpkg
Syntax
      dpkg [options] action

Actions

   -i, --install package_file...
      Install the package. If --recursive or -R option is specified, package_file must refer to a directory instead.

      Installation consists of the following steps:

      1. Extract the control files of the new package.

      2. If another version of the same package was installed before the new installation,
         execute prerm script of the old package.

      3. Run preinst script, if provided by the package.

      4. Unpack the new files, and at the same time back up the old files,
         so that if something goes wrong, they can be restored.

      5. If another version of the same package was installed before the new installation, execute the postrm
         script of the old package. Note that this script is executed after the preinst script of the new package,
         because new files are written at the same time old files are removed.

      6. Configure the package. See --configure for detailed information about how this is done. 

   --unpack package_file...
      Unpack the package, but don't configure it.
      If --recursive or -R option is specified, package_file must refer to a directory instead. 

   --configure package...|-a|--pending
      Reconfigure an unpacked package.
      If -a or --pending is given instead of package, all unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.

      Configuring consists of the following steps:

        1. Unpack the conffiles, and at the same time back up the old conffiles, so that
           they can be restored if something goes wrong.

        2. Run postinst script, if provided by the package.

   --triggers-only package...|-a|--pending
      Processes only triggers. All pending triggers will be processed.
      If package names are supplied only those packages' triggers will be processed, exactly once each where necessary.
      Use of this option may leave packages in the improper triggers-awaited and triggers-pending states.
      This can be fixed later by running: dpkg --configure --pending.

   -r, --remove, -P, --purge package...|-a|--pending
      Remove an installed package. -r or --remove remove everything except conffiles.
      This may avoid having to reconfigure the package if it is reinstalled later.
      (Conffiles are configuration files that are listed in the DEBIAN/conffiles control file).
      -P or --purge removes everything, including conffiles.
      If -a or --pending is given instead of a package name, then all packages unpacked, but marked to be removed or
      purged in file /var/lib/dpkg/status, are removed or purged, respectively.

      Note: some configuration files might be unknown to dpkg because they are created and handled separately through
      the configuration scripts. In that case, dpkg won't remove them by itself, but the package's postrm script
      (which is called by dpkg), has to take care of their removal during purge.

      Removing of a package consists of the following steps:
        1. Run prerm script
        2. Remove the installed files
        3. Run postrm script

   --update-avail, --merge-avail Packages-file
      Update dpkg's and dselect's idea of which packages are available. With action --merge-avail, old information is
      combined with information from Packages-file. With action --update-avail, old information is replaced with
      the information in the Packages-file.
      The Packages-file distributed with Debian is simply named Packages.
      dpkg keeps its record of available packages in /var/lib/dpkg/available.

      A simpler one-shot command to retrieve and update the available file is dselect update.
      Note that this file is mostly useless if you don't use dselect but an APT-based frontend: APT has its own system to
      keep track of available packages.

   -A, --record-avail package_file...
      Update dpkg and dselect's idea of which packages are available with information from the package package_file.
      If --recursive or -R option is specified, package_file must refer to a directory instead.

   --forget-old-unavail
      Now obsolete and a no-op as dpkg will automatically forget uninstalled unavailable packages.

   --clear-avail
      Erase the existing information about what packages are available.

   -C, --audit
      Search for packages that have been installed only partially on your system.
      dpkg will suggest what to do with them to get them working.

   --get-selections [package-name-pattern...]
      Get list of package selections, and write it to stdout.
      Without a pattern, non-installed packages (i.e. those which have been previously purged) will not be shown.

   --set-selections
      Set package selections using file read from stdin.
      This file should be in the format 'package state', where state is one of install, hold, deinstall or purge.
      Blank lines and comment lines beginning with '#' are also permitted.

   --clear-selections
      Set the requested state of every non-essential package to deinstall.
      This is intended to be used immediately before --set-selections, to deinstall any packages not in list
      given to --set-selections.

   --yet-to-unpack
      Searches for packages selected for installation, but which for some reason still haven't been installed.

   --print-architecture
      Print architecture of packages dpkg installs (for example, "i386").

   --compare-versions ver1 op ver2
      Compare version numbers, where op is a binary operator.
      dpkg returns success (zero result) if the specified condition is satisfied, and failure (nonzero result)
      otherwise. There are two groups of operators, which differ in how they treat an empty ver1 or ver2.
      These treat an empty version as earlier than any version: lt le eq ne ge gt.
      These treat an empty version as later than any version: lt-nl le-nl ge-nl gt-nl.
      These are provided only for compatibility with control file syntax: < << <= = >= >> >.

   --command-fd n

   --force-things, --no-force-things, --refuse-things
      Force or refuse (no-force and refuse mean the same thing) to do some things.
      things is a comma separated list of things specified below. --force-help displays a message describing them.
      Things marked with (*) are forced by default.

        Warning: These options are mostly intended to be used by experts only.
        Using them without fully understanding their effects may break your whole system.

        all: Turns on (or off) all force options.

        downgrade(*): Install a package, even if newer version of it is already installed.

        Warning:     At present dpkg does not do any dependency checking on downgrades and therefore will not warn you
                     if the downgrade breaks the dependency of some other package. This can have serious side effects,
                     downgrading essential system components can even make your whole system unusable. Use with care.

        configure-any: Configure also any unpacked but unconfigured packages on which the current package depends.

        hold:        Process packages even when marked "hold".

        remove-reinstreq: Remove a package, even if it's broken and marked to require reinstallation. This may, for example,
                          cause parts of the package to remain on the system, which will then be forgotten by dpkg.

        remove-essential: Remove, even if the package is considered essential.
                          Essential packages contain mostly very basic Unix commands. Removing them might cause the whole
                          system to stop working, so use with caution.

        depends:     Turn all dependency problems into warnings.

        depends-version: Don't care about versions when checking dependencies.

        breaks:      Install, even if this would break another package.

        conflicts:   Install, even if it conflicts with another package.
                     This is dangerous, for it will usually cause overwriting of some files.

        confmiss:    Always install a missing conffile.
                     This is dangerous, since it means not preserving a change (removing) made to the file.

        confnew:     If a conffile has been modified always install the new version without prompting, unless
                     the --force-confdef is also specified, in which case the default action is preferred.

        confold:     If a conffile has been modified always keep the old version without prompting, unless
                     the --force-confdef is also specified, in which case the default action is preferred.

        confdef:     If a conffile has been modified always choose the default action. If there is no default action
                     it will stop to ask the user unless --force-confnew or --force-confold is also been given, in
                     which case it will use that to decide the final action.

        overwrite:   Overwrite one package's file with another's file.

        overwrite-dir: Overwrite one package's directory with another's file.

        overwrite-diverted: Overwrite a diverted file with an undiverted version.

        architecture: Process even packages with the wrong architecture.

        bad-path:     PATH is missing important programs, so problems are likely.

        not-root:     Try to (de)install things even when not root.

        bad-verify:   Install a package even if it fails authenticity check.

   --ignore-depends=package,...
      Ignore dependency-checking for specified packages (actually, checking is performed, but only warnings about
      conflicts are given, nothing else).

   --new, --old
      Select new or old binary package format. This is a dpkg-deb(1) option.

   --nocheck
      Don't read or check contents of control file while building a package. This is a dpkg-deb(1) option.

   --no-act, --dry-run, --simulate
      Do everything which is supposed to be done, but don't write any changes. This is used to see what would happen with the
      specified action, without actually modifying anything.

      Be sure to give --no-act before the action-parameter, or you might end up with undesirable results. 
      (e.g. dpkg --purge foo --no-act will first purge package foo and then try to purge package --no-act, even though you
       probably expected it to actually do nothing)

   -R, --recursive
      Recursively handle all regular files matching pattern *.deb found at specified directories and all of its subdirectories.
      This can be used with -i, -A, --install, --unpack and --avail actions.

   -G
      Don't install a package if a newer version of the same package is already installed.
      This is an alias of --refuse-downgrade.

   --admindir=dir
      Change default administrative directory, which contains many files that give information about status of installed or
      uninstalled packages, etc. (Defaults to /var/lib/dpkg)

   --instdir=dir
      Change default installation directory which refers to the directory where packages are to be installed.
      instdir is also the directory passed to chroot(2) before running package's installation scripts, which means that
      the scripts see instdir as a root directory. (Defaults to /)

   --root=dir
      Changing root changes instdir to dir and admindir to dir/var/lib/dpkg.

   -O, --selected-only
      Only process the packages that are selected for installation. The actual marking is done with dselect or by dpkg,
      when it handles packages. For example, when a package is removed, it will be marked selected for deinstallation.

   -E, --skip-same-version
      Don't install the package if the same version of the package is already installed.

   --pre-invoke=command
   --post-invoke=command
      Set an invoke hook command to be run via 'sh -c' before or after the dpkg run for the unpack, configure, install,
      triggers-only, remove and purge dpkg actions. This option can be specified multiple times.
      The order the options are specified is preserved, with the ones from the configuration files taking precedence.
      The environment variable DPKG_HOOK_ACTION is set for the hooks to the current dpkg action.
      Note: front-ends might call dpkg several times per invocation, which might run the hooks more times than expected.

   --status-fd n
      Send machine-readable package status and progress information to file descriptor n.
      This option can be specified multiple times.
      The information is generally one record per line, in one of the following forms: 
         status: package: status
            Package status changed; status is as in the status file. 
         status: package : error : extended-error-message
            An error occurred. Unfortunately at the time of writing extended-error-message can contain newlines, although in
            locales where the translators have not made mistakes every newline is followed by at least one space. 
         status: file : conffile-prompt : 'real-old' 'real-new' useredited distedited
            User is being asked a conffile question. 
         processing: stage: package
            Sent just before a processing stage starts. stage is one of upgrade, install (both sent before unpacking),
            configure, trigproc, disappear, remove, purge. 

   --log=filename
      Log status change updates and actions to filename, instead of the default /var/log/dpkg.log.
      If this option is given multiple times, the last filename is used.
      Log messages are of the form 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS status state pkg installed-version' for status change
      updates; 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS action pkg installed-version available-version' for actions where
      action is one of install, upgrade, remove, purge; and 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS conffile filename decision' for conffile
      changes where decision is either install or keep.

   --no-debsig
      Do not try to verify package signatures.

   --no-triggers
      Do not run any triggers in this run (activations will still be recorded).
      If used with --configure package or --triggers-only package then the named package postinst will still be run even
      if only a triggers run is needed. Use of this option may leave packages in the improper triggers-awaited and
      triggers-pending states. This can be fixed later by running: dpkg --configure --pending.

   --triggers
      Cancels a previous --no-triggers.Package States

   not-installed     The package is not installed on your system. 
   config-files      Only the configuration files of the package exist on the system. 
   half-installed    The installation of the package has been started, but not completed for some reason. 
   unpacked          The package is unpacked, but not configured. 
   half-configured   The package is unpacked and configuration has been started, but not yet completed for some reason. 
   triggers-awaited  The package awaits trigger processing by another package. 
   triggers-pending  The package has been triggered. 
   installed         The package is unpacked and configured OK.

Package Selection States

   install    The package is selected for installation. 
   hold       A package marked to be on hold is not handled by dpkg, unless forced to do that with option --force-hold. 
   deinstall  The package is selected for deinstallation (i.e. we want to remove all files, except configuration files). 
   purge      The package is selected to be purged (i.e. we want to remove everything, even configuration files).

Package Flags

   reinst-required    A package marked reinst-required is broken and requires reinstallation.
                      These packages cannot be removed, unless forced with option --force-remove-reinstreq.-b, --build,

du
Syntax
      du [options]... [file]...Options

   -a
   --all
      Show counts for all files, not just directories.

   -b
   --bytes
      Print sizes in bytes, overriding the default block size.

   -c
   --total
      Print a grand total of all arguments after all arguments have been processed.
      This can be used to find out the total disk usage of a given set of files or directories.
     

   -D
   --dereference-args
      Dereference symbolic links that are command line arguments. Does not affect other symbolic links. 
      This helps to find the disk usage of directories, such as '/usr/tmp', which are often symbolic links.

   -h
   --human-readable
      Append a size letter such as 'M' for megabytes to each size.
      Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; 'M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.
      Use the '-H' or '--si' option if you prefer powers of 1000.

   -H
   --si
      Display size with a non-standard suffixes as follows:
      B=Byte, K=kilobyte, M=megabyte, G=gigabyte, T=teraByte and P=petabyte.

      Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; so 'M' stands for 1,000,000 bytes.
      Use the '-h' or '--human-readable' option if you prefer powers of 1024.

   -k
   --kilobytes
      Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size.

   -l
   --count-links
      Count the size of all files, even if they have appeared already (as a hard link).

   -L
   --dereference
      Dereference symbolic links (show the disk space used by the file or directory that
      the link points to instead of the space used by the link).

   --max-depth=MAX_DEPTH
      Show the total for each directory (and file if -all) that is at most MAX_DEPTH levels
      down from the root of the hierarchy.  The root is at level 0, so 'du --max-depth=0'
      is equivalent to 'du -s'.

   -m
   --megabytes
      Print sizes in megabyte (that is, 1,048,576-byte) blocks.

   -s
   --summarize
      Display only a total for each argument.

   -S
   --separate-dirs
      Report the size of each directory separately, not including the sizes of subdirectories.

   -x
   --one-file-system
      Skip directories that are on different filesystems from the one that the argument being processed is on.

   --exclude=PAT
      When recursing, skip subdirectories or files matching PAT.
      For example, 'du --exclude='*.o'' excludes files whose names end in '.o'.

   -X FILE
   --exclude-from=FILE
      Like '--exclude', except take the patterns to exclude from FILE, one per line.
       If FILE is '-', take the patterns from standard input.

egrep
Syntax
      egrep [ options ] 'PATTERN' files ...

egrep is the same as 'grep -E'

all other options are the same as grepOPTIONS

  -c  Print out a count of the lines that matched the pattern, instead of the lines themselves.

  -s  Be silent. No output is produced, and the exit value indicates whether or not the pattern was matched.
    
  -v  Invert the sense of the test. 'egrep' prints the lines that do *not* match the pattern, and
      exits successfully if the pattern was not matched.

  -i  Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input data.

  -l  Only print the names of the files that matched, not the lines that matched.

  -e PATTERN
      Use PATTERN as the regexp to match.
      The purpose of the '-e' option is to allow patterns that start with a '-'.

      eject [-vn] -T [name]
      eject [-vn] -x speed [name]
      eject [-vn] -X [name]
      eject -V

Options-h --help
       Display a brief description of the command options. 
 
   -d --default
       List the default device name. 
 
   -a on|1|off|0
   --auto on|1|off|0
       Control the auto-eject mode, supported by some devices.
       When enabled, the drive automatically ejects when the device is closed. 
 
   -c slot
   --changerslot slot
       A CD slot can be selected from an ATAPI/IDE CD changer.
       The CD drive can not be in use (mounted data CD or playing a music CD) for a change request to work.
       The first slot of the changer is referred to as 0, not 1. 
 
   -t --trayclose
       Send a CD tray close command. Not all devices support this command. 
 
   -T --traytoggle
       Send a CD tray close command if it's opened, and a CD tray eject command if it's closed.
       Not all devices support this command, because it uses the above CD tray close command. 
 
   -x speed
   --cdspeed speed
       Send a CD select speed command.
       The speed argument is a number indicating the desired speed (e.g. 8 for 8X speed), or 0 for maximum data rate.
       Not all devices support this command and you can only specify speeds that the drive is capable of.
       Every time the media is changed this option is cleared. This option can be used alone, or with the -t and -c options. 
 
   -X --listspeed
       Probe the CD drive to detect the available speeds.
       The output is a list of speeds which can be used as an argument of the -x option.
       Some drives can not correctly report the speed and therefore this option does not work with them. 
 
   -n --noop
       The selected device is displayed but no action is performed. 
 
   -r --cdrom
       Eject the drive using a CDROM eject command. 
 
   -s --scsi
       Eject the drive using SCSI commands. 
 
   -f --floppy
       Eject the drive using a removable floppy disk eject command. 
 
   -q --tape
       Eject the drive using a tape drive offline command. 
 
   -p --proc
       Use /proc/mounts instead /etc/mtab. It also passes the -n option to umount(1). 
 
   -m --no-unmount
       Allow eject to work with device drivers which automatically mount removable media and therefore must be always mount()ed.
       The option tells eject to not try to unmount the given device, even if it is mounted according to
       /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.

   -v --verbose
       Run in verbose mode; more information is displayed about what the command is doing.-V --version
       Display the program version and exit.

 0 if EXPRESSION is neither null nor 0,
 1 if EXPRESSION is null or 0,
 2 if EXPRESSION is syntactically invalid, 
 3 if an error occurred.STRING : REGEX
     Perform pattern matching.  The arguments are coerced to strings
     and the second is considered to be a (basic, a la GNU 'grep')
     regular expression, with a '^' implicitly prepended.  The first
     argument is then matched against this regular expression.

     If the match succeeds and REGEX uses '\(' and '\)', the ':'
     expression returns the part of STRING that matched the
     subexpression; otherwise, it returns the number of characters
     matched.

     If the match fails, the ':' operator returns the null string if
     '\(' and '\)' are used in REGEX, otherwise 0.

     Only the first '\( ... \)' pair is relevant to the return value;
     additional pairs are meaningful only for grouping the regular
     expression operators.

     In the regular expression, '\+', '\?', and '\|' are operators
     which respectively match one or more, zero or one, or separate
     alternatives.  SunOS and other 'expr''s treat these as regular
     characters.  (POSIX allows either behavior.)

match STRING REGEX
     An alternative way to do pattern matching.  This is the same as
     STRING : REGEX.

substr STRING POSITION LENGTH
     Returns the substring of STRING beginning at POSITION with length
     at most LENGTH.  If either POSITION or LENGTH is negative, zero,
     or non-numeric, returns the null string.

index STRING CHARSET
     Returns the first position in STRING where the first character in
     CHARSET was found.  If no character in CHARSET is found in STRING,
     return 0.

length STRING
     Returns the length of STRING.

quote TOKEN
     Interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a keyword like MATCH or
     an operator like /.  This makes it possible to test 'expr length
     quote "$x"' or 'expr quote "$x" : '.*/\(.\)'' and have it do the
     right thing even if the value of $X happens to be (for example)
     '/' or 'index'.  This operator is a GNU extension.  It is disabled
     when the environment variable 'POSIXLY_CORRECT' is set.

To make 'expr' interpret keywords as strings, you must use the
'quote' operator.# A partial match will return the number of characters that match:
$ expr ss64 : ss6
3

# The condition in string 2 must entirely match string 1
$ expr ss64 : ss7
0

# Adding numbers
$ expr 5 + 2
7

# When multiplying the * has to be escaped
$ expr 5 \* 3
15

# Incrementing a variable (arithmetic expansion)
$ DEMO=1
$ DEMO='expr $DEMO + 1'
$ echo $DEMO
2
$ DEMO='expr $DEMO + 1'
$ echo $DEMO
3

# To print the non-directory part of the file name stored in '$FNAME,
  which need not contain a '/'.
$ expr $FNAME : '.*/\(^.*\)' '^|' $FNAME

      file -C [-m magicfiles]

      file [--help]

Key

   -b, --brief     Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).
   -C, --compile   Write a magic.mgc output file that contains a pre-parsed version of the magic file or directory.
   -c, --checking-printout
                   Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic file.
                   This is usually used in conjunction with the -m flag to debug a
                   new magic file before installing it.
   -e, --exclude testname
                   Exclude the test named in testname from the list of tests made to determine the file type.
                   Valid test names are:
                      apptype     EMX application type (only on EMX).
                      text        Various types of text files (this test will try to guess the text encoding,
                                  irrespective of the setting of the 'encoding' option).
                      encoding    Different text encodings for soft magic tests.
                      tokens      Look for known tokens inside text files.
                      cdf         Print details of Compound Document Files.
                      compress    Check for, and looks inside, compressed files.
                      elf         Print ELF file details.
                      soft        Consult magic files.
                      tar         Examine tar files.
   -F, --separator separator
                   Use the specified string as the separator between the filename and
                   the file result returned. Defaults to ':'.

   -f, --files-from namefile
                   Read the names of the files to be examined from namefile (one per line)
                   before the argument list. Either namefile or at least one filename argument
                   must be present; to test the standard input, use '-' as a filename argument.

   -h, --no-dereference
                   option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support symbolic links).
                   This is the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not defined.

   -i, --mime      Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than the more
                   traditional human readable ones. Thus it might say 'text/plain; charset=us-ascii'
                   rather than 'ASCII text'. In order for this option to work, file
                   changes the way it handles files recognized by the command itself
                   (such as many of the text file types, directories etc), and makes
                   use of an alternative 'magic' file. (See the FILES section, below).

   --mime-type, --mime-encoding
                   Like -i, but print only the specified element(s).

   -k, --keep-going
                   Don't stop at the first match, keep going. Subsequent matches will
                   have the string '\012- ' prepended.  (If you want a newline, see -r)

   -L, --dereference
                   option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option in ls
                   (on systems that support symbolic links).
                   This is the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.

   -m, --magic-file magicfiles
                   Specify an alternate list of files and directories containing magic.
                   This can be a single item, or a colon-separated list.
                   If a compiled magic file is found alongside a file or directory, it will be used instead.

   -N, --no-pad    Don't pad filenames so that they align in the output.

   -n, --no-buffer Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file. This is only useful if checking
                  a list of files. It is intended to be used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe.

   -p, --preserve-date
                   On systems that support utime(2) or utimes(2), attempt to preserve the access time
                   of files analyzed, to pretend that file never read them.

   -r, --raw       Don't translate unprintable characters to \ooo. Normally file translates unprintable
                   characters to their octal representation.

   -s, --special-files
                   Normally, file only attempts to read and determine the type of argument files which
                   stat(2) reports are ordinary files. This prevents problems,  because reading special files
                   can have peculiar consequences.
                   Specifying the -s option causes file to also read argument files which  are block or character
                   special files. This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in raw disk
                   partitions, which are block special files.
                   This option also causes file to disregard the file size as reported by stat(2) since on some
                   systems it reports a zero size for raw disk partitions.

   -v, --version   Print the version of the program and exit.
   -z, --uncompress
                   Try to look inside compressed files.

   -0, --print0    Output a null character '\0' after the end of the filename.
                   Nice to cut(1) the output. This does not affect the separator which is still printed.

   --help          Print a help message and exit./usr/share/misc/magic.mgc  Default compiled list of magic.

fmt
Syntax
     fmt [option(s)]... [file]...

Options

   -c
   --crown-margin
       "Crown margin" mode: preserve the indentation of the first two lines within a paragraph,
       and align the left margin of each subsequent line with that of the second line.

   -t
   --tagged-paragraph
       "Tagged paragraph" mode: like crown margin mode, except that if indentation
       of the first line of a paragraph is the same as the indentation of the
       second, the first line is treated as a one-line paragraph.

   -s
   --split-only
       Split lines only.  Do not join short lines to form longer ones.
       This prevents sample lines of code, and other such "formatted" text from being unduly combined.

   -u
   --uniform-spacing
       Uniform spacing. Reduce spacing between words to one space, and spacing between sentences to two spaces.

   -WIDTH
   -w WIDTH
   --width=WIDTH
       Fill output lines up to WIDTH characters (default 75).  'fmt' initially tries to 
       make lines about 7% shorter than this, to give it room to balance line lengths. 

   -p PREFIX
   --prefix=PREFIX
       Only lines beginning with PREFIX (possibly preceded by whitespace) are subject
       to formatting. The prefix and any preceding whitespace are stripped for the
       formatting and then re-attached to each formatted output line.
       One use is to format certain kinds of program comments, while leaving the code unchanged.

fuser
Syntax
      fuser [-a|-s|-c] [-4|-6] [-n space ] [-k [-i] [-signal ] ] [-muvf] name

      fuser -l

      fuser -V 

Options:

   -a   Show all files specified on the command line.
        By default, only files that are accessed by at least one process are shown.

   -c   Same as -m option, used for POSIX compatibility.

   -f   Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.

   -k   Kill processes accessing the file.
        Unless changed with -signal, SIGKILL is sent.
        An fuser process never kills itself, but can kill other fuser processes.
        The effective user ID of the process executing fuser is set to its real
        user ID before attempting to kill.

   -i   Ask the user for confirmation before killing a process.
        This option is silently ignored if -k (kill) is not present too.

   -l   List all known signal names.

   -m name Specifies a file on a mounted file system or a block device that is mounted.
           All processes accessing files on that file system are listed.
           If a directory file is specified, it is automatically changed to name/. 
           to use any file system that might be mounted on that directory.

   -n space   Select a different name space.
              The name spaces file (file names, the default), udp (local UDP ports),
              and tcp (local TCP ports) are supported. For ports, either the port number or
              the symbolic name can be specified.
              If there is no ambiguity, the shortcut notation name/Ispace (e.g. 80/tcp ) can be used. 

   -s   Silent operation. -u and -v are ignored in this mode.
        -a must not be used with -s.

   -signal  Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing processes.
            Signals can be specified either by name (e.g. -HUP) or by number (e.g. -1).
            This option is silently ignored if the -k (kill)option is not used. 

   -u   Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.

   -v   Verbose mode. Processes are shown in a ps-like style.
        The fields PID, USER and COMMAND are similar to ps.
        ACCESS shows how the process accesses the file. If the access is by the kernel
        (e.g. in the case of a mount point, a swap file, etc.), kernel is shown instead of the PID.

   -V   Display version information.

   -4   Search only for IPv4 sockets.
        This option must not be used with the -6 option and only has an effect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

   -6   Search only for IPv6 sockets.
        This option must not be used with the -4 option and only has an effect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

   -    Reset all options and set the signal back to SIGKILL.

awk or gawk (gnu awk)
Syntax

      awk <options> 'Program' Input-File1 Input-File2 ...

      awk -f PROGRAM-FILE <options> Input-File1 Input-File2 ...

Key
 -F FS
 --field-separator FS
     Use FS for the input field separator (the value of the 'FS'
     predefined variable).

 -f PROGRAM-FILE
 --file PROGRAM-FILE
     Read the awk program source from the file PROGRAM-FILE, instead
     of from the first command line argument.

 -mf NNN
 -mr NNN
     The 'f' flag sets the maximum number of fields, and the 'r' flag
     sets the maximum record size.  These options are ignored by
     'gawk', since 'gawk' has no predefined limits; they are only for
     compatibility with the Bell Labs research version of Unix awk.

 -v VAR=VAL
 --assign VAR=VAL
     Assign the variable VAR the value VAL before program execution
     begins.

 -W traditional
 -W compat
 --traditional
 --compat
     Use compatibility mode, in which 'gawk' extensions are turned off.

 -W lint
 --lint
     Give warnings about dubious or non-portable awk constructs.

 -W lint-old
 --lint-old
     Warn about constructs that are not available in the original
     Version 7 Unix version of awk.

 -W posix
 --posix
     Use POSIX compatibility mode, in which 'gawk' extensions are
     turned off and additional restrictions apply.

 -W re-interval
 --re-interval
     Allow interval expressions, in regexps.

 -W source=PROGRAM-TEXT
 --source PROGRAM-TEXT
     Use PROGRAM-TEXT as awk program source code.  This option allows
     mixing command line source code with source code from files, and is
     particularly useful for mixing command line programs with library
     functions.

 --
     Signal the end of options.  This is useful to allow further
     arguments to the awk program itself to start with a '-'.  This
     is mainly for consistency with POSIX argument parsing conventions.

'Program'
     A series of patterns and actions: see below

Input-File
     If no Input-File is specified then awk applies the Program to 
     "standard input", (piped output of some other command or the terminal.
     Typed input will continue until end-of-file (typing 'Control-d')pattern { action }
     pattern { action }

BEGIN                       - Perform action BEFORE input file is read
END                         - Perform action AFTER input file is readCONVFMT  conversion  format  used  when  converting  numbers
              (default %.6g)

     FS       regular  expression  used  to separate fields; also
              settable by option -Ffs.

     NF       number of fields in the current record

     NR       ordinal number of the current record

     FNR      ordinal number of the current record in the current
              file

     FILENAME the name of the current input file

     RS       input record separator (default newline)

     OFS      output field separator (default blank)

     ORS      output record separator (default newline)

     OFMT     output format for numbers (default %.6g)

     SUBSEP   separates multiple subscripts (default 034)

     ARGC     argument count, assignable

     ARGV     argument  array,  assignable;  non-null members are
              taken as filenames

********************

getopts
Syntax
      getopts optstring name [args]

Options
      optstring : The option characters to be recognized

      If a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to 
      have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space. 
      The colon (':') and question mark ('?') can not be used as option characters.

********************

grep
Syntax
      grep [options] PATTERN [FILE...]
      grep [options] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]

A simple example:
$ grep "Needle in a Haystack" /etc/*

Options
   -A NUM
   --after-context=NUM
       Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches. 
   -a
   --text
       Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent
       to the --binary-files=text option.

   -B NUM
   --before-context=NUM
       Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches.

   -b
   --byte-offset
       Print the byte offset within the input file before each line of output.

   --binary-files=TYPE
       If the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file contains binary data, assume 
       that the file is of type TYPE. By default, TYPE is binary, and grep normally outputs
       either a one-line message saying that a binary file matches, or no message if there
       is no match. If TYPE is without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does not match;
       this is equivalent to the -I option. If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary file as
       if it were text; this is equivalent to the -a option.
       Warning: grep --binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can have nasty
       side effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some
       of it as commands.

   --colour[=WHEN]
   --color[=WHEN]
       Surround the matching string with the marker from the GREP_COLOR environment variable.
       WHEN can be 'never', 'always', or 'auto' e.g. --color=always       By default the matched text will be colored red.
       If grep is made to match several strings, all of the matches will be colored, one exception
       is the regex ^ (match beginning of every line), the beginning of a line has no length so will
       not be coloued.
       So to return all lines and colour only matches: egrep --color=always '^|string1|string2'

   -C NUM
   --context=NUM
       Print NUM lines of output context.
       Places a line containing -- between contiguous groups of matches. 
   -c
   --count
       Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
       With the -v, --invert-match option (see below), count non-matching lines.

   -D ACTION
   --devices=ACTION
       If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to process it.
       By default, ACTION is read, which means that devices are read just as if they were
       ordinary files. If ACTION is skip, devices are silently skipped.

   -d ACTION
   --directories=ACTION
       If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.
       By default, ACTION is read, which means that directories are read just as if they
       were ordinary files. If ACTION is skip, directories are silently skipped.
       If ACTION is recurse, grep reads all files under each directory, recursively; this
       is equivalent to the -r option.

   -E
   --extended-regexp
       Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression.

   -e PATTERN
   --regexp=PATTERN
       Use PATTERN as the pattern; useful to protect patterns beginning with -.

   -F
   --fixed-strings
       Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines,
       any of which is to be matched.

   -f FILE
   --file=FILE
       Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line. The empty file contains zero
       patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

   -G
   --basic-regexp
       Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular expression This is the default.
 
   -H
   --with-filename
       Print the filename for each match.

   -h
   --no-filename
       Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are searched.

   --help
      Output a brief help message.

   -I
      Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is
      equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.

   -i
   --ignore-case
      Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the input files.

   -L
   --files-without-match
      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which
      no output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.

   -l
   --files-with-matches
      Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which
      output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.

   -m NUM
   --max-count=NUM
      Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.
      If the input is standard input from a regular file, and NUM matching lines are
      output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after the last
      matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.
      This enables a calling process to resume a search. When grep stops after NUM matching
      lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.
      When the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not output a count greater
      than NUM. When the -v or --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after
      outputting NUM non-matching lines.

   --mmap
      If possible, use the mmap(2) system call to read input, instead of the default
      read(2) system call. In some situations, --mmap yields better performance.
      However, --mmap can cause undefined behavior (including core dumps) if an input
      file shrinks while grep is operating, or if an I/O error occurs.

   -n
   --line-number
      Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file. 

   -o
   --only-matching
       Show only the part of a matching line that matches PATTERN.

   --label=LABEL
       Display input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file LABEL.
       This is especially useful for tools like zgrep, e.g. gzip -cd foo.gz |grep --label=foo something

   --line-buffered
       Use line buffering, it can be a performance penality.

   -P
   --perl-regexp
       Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular expression.

   -q
   --quiet, --silent
       Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.
       Exit immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if an error
       was detected. Also see the -s or --no-messages option.

   -R
   -r
   --recursive
       Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the '-d recurse' option. 
       Not all grep implementations support -r and among those that do, the behaviour with symlinks may differ.

   --include=PATTERN
       Recurse in directories only searching file matching PATTERN. 
   --exclude=PATTERN
       Recurse in directories skip file matching PATTERN.
 
   -s
   --no-messages
       Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
       Portability note: unlike GNU grep, traditional grep did not conform to POSIX.2 ,
       because traditional grep lacked a -q option and its -s option behaved like
       GNU grep's -q option. Shell scripts intended to be portable to traditional grep
       should avoid both -q and -s and should redirect output to /dev/null instead.

   -U, --binary
       Treat the file(s) as binary. 
       By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, grep guesses the file type by looking at
       the contents of the first 32KB read from the file. If grep decides the file is a
       text file, it strips the CR characters from the original file contents
       (to make regular expressions with ^ and $ work correctly).
       Specifying -U overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed
       to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs
       at the end of each line, this will cause some regular expressions to fail.
       This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
 
   -u
   --unix-byte-offsets
       Report Unix-style byte offsets.
       This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text
       file, i.e. with CR characters stripped off. This will produce results identical to
       running grep on a Unix machine.
       This option has no effect unless -b option is also used; it has no effect on
       platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

   -V
   --version
       Print the version number of grep to standard error.
       This version number should be included in all bug reports (see below). 
   -v
   --invert-match
       Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines. 
   -w
   --word-regexp
       Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
       The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning of
       the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character. Similarly, it
       must be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent
       character. Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.

   -x
   --line-regexp
       Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line. 
   -y
       Obsolete synonym for -i.
   -Z
   --null
       Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character that
       normally follows a file name. For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after
       each file name instead of the usual newline.
       This option makes the output unambiguous, even in the presence of file names
       containing unusual characters like newlines.
       This option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and
       xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.GREP_OPTIONS                 - default options
GREP_COLOR                   - The marker for highlighting
LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LANG     - These variables specify the LC_COLLATE locale,

groupadd
Syntax
      groupadd [options] groupOptions

   -f, --force
       This option causes the command to exit with
       success status if the specified group already exists.
       When used with -g, and the specified GID already exists,
       another (unique) GID is chosen (i.e. -g is turned off). 

   -g, --gid GID
       The numerical value of the group's ID.
       This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.
       The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the
       smallest ID value greater than 999 and greater than every
       other group. Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved
       for system accounts. 

   -h, --help
       Display help message and exit.

   -K, --key KEY=VALUE
       Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults
       (GID_MIN, GID_MAX and others).
       Multiple -K options can be specified.

       Example: -K GID_MIN=100 -K GID_MAX=499

       Note: -K GID_MIN=10,GID_MAX=499 doesn't work yet.

   -o, --non-unique
       This option permits to add a group with a non-unique GID.

   -p, --password PASSWORD
       The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).
       The default is to disable the password.

       Note: This option is not recommended because the password
       (or encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes.

       You should make sure the password respects the system's password policy.
 
   -r, --system
       Create a system group.

       The numeric identifiers of new system groups are choosen in
       the SYS_GID_MIN-SYS_GID_MAX range, defined in login.defs,
       instead of GID_MIN-GID_MAX./etc/group       Group account information.

groupmod
Syntax
      groupmod [options] GROUPOptions
   -g, --gid GID
   
       The group ID of the given GROUP will be changed to GID.
       The value of GID must be a non-negative decimal integer.
       This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.
       Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system groups.

       Any files that have the old group ID and must continue to
       belong to GROUP, must have their group ID changed manually.

   -h, --help
       Display help message and exit.

   -n, --new-name NEW_GROUP
       The name of the group will be changed from GROUP to NEW_GROUP.

   -o, --non-unique
       When used with the -g option, allow to change the
       group GID to a non-unique value.

   -p, --password PASSWORD
       The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).

       Note: This option is not recommended because the

gzip
Syntax
     gzip options ...

Options

   --stdout
   --to-stdout
   -c
        Write output on standard output; keep original files unchanged. 
        If there are several input files, the output consists of a sequence of independently compressed members.
        To obtain better compression, concatenate all input files before compressing them.

   --decompress
   --uncompress
   -d
        Decompress.

   --force
   -f
        Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple links or the corresponding file
        already exists, or if the compressed data is read from or written to a terminal.
        If the input data is not in a format recognized by 'gzip', and if the option --stdout
        is also given, copy the input data without change to the standard ouput: let 'zcat' behave as 'cat'.

        If '-f' is not given, and when not running in the background, 'gzip' prompts to verify whether
        an existing file should be overwritten.

   --help
   -h
        Print a help message describing the options, then quit.

   --list
   -l
        For each compressed file, list the following fields:

          compressed size:   size of the compressed file
          uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
          ratio:             compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
          uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

          The uncompressed size is given as '-1' for files not in 'gzip' format.

   --license
   -L
        Display the 'gzip' license then quit.

   --no-name
   -n
        When compressing, do not save the original file name and time stamp by default.
        (The original name is always saved if the name had to be truncated.)
        When decompressing, do not restore the original file name if present
        (remove only the 'gzip' suffix from the compressed file name)
        and do not restore the original time stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file).
        This option is the default when decompressing.

   --name
   -N
        When compressing, always save the original file name and time stamp; this is the default.
        When decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp if present.
        This option is useful on systems which have a limit on file name length or when
        the time stamp has been lost after a file transfer.

   --quiet
   -q
        Suppress all warning messages.

   --recursive
   -r
        Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names specified on the command line
        are directories, 'gzip' will descend into the directory and compress all the files
        it finds there (or decompress them in the case of 'gunzip').

   --suffix SUF
   -S SUF
        Use suffix SUF instead of '.gz'.
        Any suffix can be given, but suffixes other than '.z' and '.gz' should be avoided to avoid
        confusion when files are transferred to other systems.
        A null suffix forces gunzip to try decompression on all given files regardless of suffix, as in:

          gunzip -S "" *        (*.* for MSDOS)

        Previous versions of gzip used the '.z' suffix. This was changed to avoid a conflict with 'pack'.

   --test
   -t
        Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

   --verbose
   -v
        Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed.

   --version
   -V
        Version. Display the version number and compilation options, then quit.

   --fast
   --best
   -N
        Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit N, where '-1' or '--fast'
        indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)  and '--best' or '-9' 
        indicates the slowest compression method (optimal compression).
        The default compression level is '-6' (that is, biased towards high compression at expense of speed).

********************

hash
Syntax
      hash [-r] [-p filename] [name] 

Options
      -r   Reset, causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.

      -p   Use filename as the location of name (don't search $PATH).

********************

head
Syntax
      head [options]... [file]...

Options:

  -NUMBER
     Return the first NUMBER of lines from the file. (must be the first option specified)

  -CountOptions-c BYTES
  --bytes=BYTES
       Print the first BYTES bytes, instead of initial lines.  Appending
       'b' multiplies BYTES by 512, 'k' by 1024, and 'm' by 1048576.

  -n N
  --lines=N
       Output the first N lines.

  -q
  --quiet
  --silent
       Never print file name headers.

  -v
  --verbose
       Always print file name headers.

********************

history
Syntax
      history 
      history [n]
      history -c
      history -d offset
      history [-anrw] [filename]
      history -ps arg

Key
   -c   Clear the history list. This can be combined with the other
        options to replace the history list completely.

   -d offset 
        Delete the history entry at position offset. 
        offset should be specified as it appears when the history is displayed. 

   -a   Append the new history lines (history lines entered since 
        the beginning of the current Bash session) to the history file. 

   -n   Append the history lines not already read from the history file 
        to the current history list. These are lines appended to the 
        history file since the beginning of the current Bash session. 

   -r   Read the current history file and append its contents to the history list. 

   -w   Write out the current history to the history file. 

   -p   Perform history substitution on the args and display the result 
        on the standard output, without storing the results in the history list. 

   -s   The args are added to the end of the history list as a single entry.!             Start a history substitution, except when followed by a space, 
              tab, the end of the line, '=' or '('. 

!n            Refer to command line n. 

!-n           Refer to the command n lines back. 

!!            Refer to the previous command. This is a synonym for '!-1'. 

!string       Refer to the most recent command starting with string. 

!?string[?]   Refer to the most recent command containing string. 
              The trailing '?' can be omitted if the string is followed 
              immediately by a newline. 

^string1^string2^   Quick Substitution. Repeat the last command, replacing string1 
                    with string2. Equivalent to !!:s/string1/string2/. 

!#            The entire command line typed so far.For example, 

!!      designates the preceding command. When you type this, the 
        preceding command is repeated in toto. 

!!:$    designates the last argument of the preceding command. 
        This can be shortened to !$. 

!fi:2   designates the second argument of the most recent command 
        starting with the letters fi. 

Here are the word designators: 

0 (zero) The 0th word. For many applications, this is the command word.

n        The nth word. 

^        The first argument; that is, word 1. 

$        The last argument. 

%        The word matched by the most recent '?string?' search. 

x-y      A range of words; '-y' abbreviates '0-y'. 

*        All of the words, except the 0th. This is a synonym for '1-$'. 
         It is not an error to use '*' if there is just one word in the event;
         the empty string is returned in that case. 

x*       Abbreviates 'x-$' 

x-       Abbreviates 'x-$' like 'x*', but omits the last word.

If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, 
the previous command is used as the event.h   Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head. 

t   Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail. 

r   Remove a trailing suffix of the form '.suffix', leaving the basename. 

e   Remove all but the trailing suffix. 

p   Print the new command but do not execute it. 

q   Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions. 

x   Quote the substituted words as with 'q', but break into words at
    spaces, tabs, and newlines.

s/old/new/ 
    Substitute new for the first occurrence of old in the event line. 
    Any delimiter can be used in place of '/'. The delimiter can be 
    quoted in old and new with a single backslash. 
    If '&' appears in new, it is replaced by old. 
    A single backslash will quote the '&'. 
    The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character on the input line. 

&   Repeat the previous substitution. 

g   Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line. 
    Used in conjunction with 's', as in gs/old/new/, or with '&'.Full line: % !!            becomes: % vi foo.c bar.c
 Last arg : % svn ci !$     becomes: % svn ci bar.c

          encoding with a placeholder string that is constructed from formatstring,
          applied to the Unicode code point. The formatstring must be in the same
          format as for the printf command or the  printf() function, taking either
          no argument or exactly one unsigned integer argument.

   --byte-subst=formatstring
          Replace bytes in the input that are not valid in the source encoding 
          with a placeholder string constructed from the given formatstring,
          applied to the byte's value. The formatstring must be in the same
          format as for the printf command or  the  printf()  function, taking either
          no argument or exactly one unsigned integer argument.

   --widechar-subst=formatstring
          Replace wide characters in the input that are not valid in the source
          encoding with a placeholder string that is constructed from the given
          formatstring, applied to the byte's value. The formatstring must
          be in the same format as for the printf command or the  printf() function,
          taking either no argument or exactly one unsigned integer argument.

ifconfig
Syntax
      ifconfig [interface]

      ifconfig interface [aftype] options | address ...

Options
   interface    The name of the interface.
                Usually a driver name followed by a unit number, eth0 = 1st Ethernet interface. 

   up           This flag causes the interface to be activated.
                It is implicitly specified if an address is assigned to the interface. 

   down         This flag causes the driver for this interface to be shut down. 

   [-]arp       Enable or disable the use of the ARP protocol on this interface. 

   [-]promisc   Enable or disable the promiscuous mode of the interface.
                If selected, all packets on the network will be received by the interface. 

   [-]allmulti  Enable or disable all-multicast mode.
                If selected, all multicast packets on the network will be received by the interface. 

   metric N     Set the interface metric. 

   mtu N        Set the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of an interface.
                To make this change permanent, edit:
                /etc/network/interfaces    Debian / Ubuntu
                /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0   CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

   dstaddr addr    Set the remote IP address for a point-to-point (PPP)link (obsolete; use pointopoint instead) 

   netmask addr    Set the IP network mask for this interface.
                   This value defaults to the usual class A, B or C network mask
                   (as derived from the interface IP address), but it can be set to any value. 

   add addr/prefixlen    Add an IPv6 address to an interface. 

   del addr/prefixlen    Remove an IPv6 address from an interface.

   tunnel aa.bb.cc.dd    Create a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) device, tunnelling to the given destination. 

   irq addr         Set the interrupt line used by this device.
                    Not all devices can dynamically change their IRQ setting. 

   io_addr addr    Set the start address in I/O space for this device. 

   mem_start addr  Set the start address for shared memory used by this device.
                   Only a few devices need this. 

   media type      Set the physical port or medium type to be used by the device.
                   Not all devices can change this setting, and those that can vary
                   in what values they support. Typical values for type are 10base2 (thin Ethernet),
                   10baseT (twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet), AUI (external transceiver) and so on.
                   The special medium type of auto can be used to tell the driver to auto-sense the
                   media. Again, not all drivers can do this. 

   [-]broadcast [addr]    If the address argument is given, set the protocol broadcast address
                          for this interface. Otherwise, set (or clear) the IFF_BROADCAST flag for
                          the interface. 

   [-]pointopoint [addr]  This keyword enables the point-to-point mode of an interface,meaning that 
                          it is a direct link between two machines with nobody else listening on it.
                          If the address argument is also given, set the protocol address of the other
                          side of the link, just like the obsolete dstaddr keyword does.
                          Otherwise, set or clear the IFF_POINTOPOINT flag for the interface. 

   hw class address    Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver supports
                       this operation. The keyword must be followed by the name of the hardware class
                       and the printable ASCII equivalent of the hardware address. Hardware classes
                       currently supported include ether (Ethernet), ax25 (AMPR AX.25), ARCnet and
                       netrom (AMPR NET/ROM). 

   multicast           Set the multicast flag on the interface. Not normally be needed as
                       the drivers set the flag correctly themselves. 

   address             The IP address to be assigned to this interface. 

   txqueuelen length   Set the length of the transmit queue of the device.
                       It is useful to set this to small values for slower devices with a high
                       latency (modem links, ISDN) to prevent fast bulk transfers from disturbing
                       interactive traffic like telnet too much.

install
Syntax
      install [options]... SOURCE DEST

   -b
   --backup
       Make a backup of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or
       removed.  *Note Backup options::.

   -C
       Install file, unless target already exists and is the same file,
       in which case the modification time is not changed.

   -c
       Ignored; for compatibility with old Unix versions of 'install'.

   -d
   --directory
       Create each given directory and any missing parent directories, setting the owner,
       group and mode as given on the command line or to the defaults.
       It also gives any parent directories it creates those attributes.

   -g GROUP
   --group=GROUP
       Set the group ownership of installed files or directories to GROUP.
       The default is the process's current group. GROUP can be either a group name
       or a numeric group id.

   -m MODE
   --mode=MODE
       Set the permissions for the installed file or directory to MODE, which can be
       either an octal number, or a symbolic mode as in 'chmod', with 0 as the point
       of departure (*note File permissions::).
       The default mode is 0755--read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for group and other.

   -o OWNER
   --owner=OWNER
       If 'install' has appropriate privileges (is run as root), set the ownership of installed 
       files or directories to OWNER. The default is 'root'.
       OWNER can be either a user name or a numeric user ID.

   -p
   --preserve-timestamps
       Set the time of last access and the time of last modification of each installed file
       to match those of each corresponding original file.
       When a file is installed without this option, its last access and last modification
       times are both set to the time of installation.
       This option is useful if you want to use the last modification times of installed files 
       to keep track of when they were last built as opposed to when they were last installed.

   -s
   --strip
       Strip the symbol tables from installed binary executables.

   -S SUFFIX
   --suffix=SUFFIX
       Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with '-b'.

   -v
   --verbose
       Print the name of each file before copying it.

   -V METHOD
   --version-control=METHOD
       Change the type of backups made with '-b'.
       The METHOD argument can be 'numbered' (or 't'), 'existing' (or 'nil'), or 'never' (or 'simple').

iostat
Syntax
      iostat [option(s)] [ device [...] | ALL ]
                [ -p [ device [,...] | ALL ] ]  [ interval [ count ] ]

Options

   -c    Display the CPU utilization report.

   -d    Display the device utilization report.

   -h    Make the NFS report displayed by option -n easier to read by a human.

   -k    Display statistics in kilobytes per second instead of blocks per second.
         Data displayed are valid only with kernels 2.4 and later.

   -m    Display statistics in megabytes per second instead of blocks or kilobytes per second.
         Data displayed are valid only with kernels 2.4 and later.

   -N    Display the registered device mapper names for any device mapper devices.
         Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.

   -n    Display the network filesystem (NFS) report.
         This option works only with kernel 2.6.17 and later.

   -p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ]
         The -p option displays statistics for block devices and all their partitions that are used by the system.
         If a device name is entered on the command line, then statistics for it and all its partitions
         are displayed. Last, the ALL keyword indicates that statistics have to be displayed for all the block
         devices and partitions defined by the system, including those that have never been used.
         Note that this option works only with post 2.5 kernels.

   -t    Print the time for each report displayed.
         The timestamp format may depend on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment variable (see below).

   -V    Print version number then exit.

   -x    Display extended statistics.
         This option works with post 2.5 kernels since it needs /proc/diskstats file or a mounted sysfs to get
         the statistics. This option may also work with older kernels (e.g. 2.4) only if extended statistics are
         available in /proc/partitions (the kernel needs to be patched for that).

   -z    Tell iostat to omit output for any devices for which there was no activity during the sample period.

   interval  The number of seconds between each sample.

   count The number of samples to return.

OPTIONS

   -f, -family
       followed by protocol family identifier: inet, inet6 or link ,enforce the protocol family to use.
       If the option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other arguments.
       If the rest of the command line does not give enough information to guess the family, ip falls
       back to the default one, usually inet or any. link is a special family identifier meaning that
       no networking protocol is involved. 

   -4  shortcut for -family inet. (IPv4)

   -6  shortcut for -family inet6. (IPv6)

   -0  shortcut for -family link.
   -o, -oneline
       output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with the '\' character.
       This is convenient when you want to count records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output. 

   -r, -resolve
    use the system's name resolver to print DNS names instead of host addresses. 

   -s, -stats, -statistics
       output more information. If the option appears twice or more, the amount of information increases.
       As a rule, the information is statistics or some time values.

   -V, -Version
       print the version of the ip utility and exit. 

OBJECTS with abbreviations

COMMAND

********************

jobs
Syntax
      jobs [OPTIONS] [PID]


Options:
   -c 
   --command  Print the command name for each process in jobs

   -g
   --group    Only print the group id of each job

   -h
   --help     Display a help message and exit

   -l
   --last     Only the last job to be started is printed

   -p
   --pid      Print the process id for each process in all jobs

********************

join
Syntax
      join [Options]... File1 File2

Options

   -a FILE-NUMBER
       Print a line for each unpairable line in file FILE-NUMBER (either '1' or '2'),
       in addition to the normal output.

   -e STRING
       Replace those output fields that are missing in the input with STRING.

   -i
   --ignore-case
      Ignore differences in case when comparing keys.  With this option, the lines of the
      input files must be ordered in the same way.  Use 'sort -f' to produce this ordering.

   -1 FIELD
   -j1 FIELD
      Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 1.

  -2 FIELD
   -j2 FIELD
      Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 2.

   -j FIELD
      Equivalent to '-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'.

   -o FIELD-LIST...
      Construct each output line according to the format in FIELD-LIST.
      Each element in FIELD-LIST is either the single character '0' or has the form M.N where
      the file number, M, is '1' or '2' and N is a positive field number.

      A field specification of '0' denotes the join field.  In most cases, the functionality
      of the '0' field spec can be reproduced using the explicit M.N that corresponds to the join field.
      However, when printing unpairable lines (using either of the '-a' or '-v' options), there is no
      way to specify the join field using M.N in FIELD-LIST if there are unpairable lines in both files.
      To give 'join' that functionality, POSIX invented the '0' field specification notation.

      The elements in FIELD-LIST are separated by commas or blanks.
      Multiple FIELD-LIST arguments can be given after a single '-o' option; the values of
      all lists given with '-o' are concatenated together.
      All output lines - including those printed because of any -a or -v option - are subject to
      the specified FIELD-LIST.

   -t CHAR
      Use character CHAR as the input and output field separator.

   -v FILE-NUMBER
      Print a line for each unpairable line in file FILE-NUMBER (either '1' or '2'),
      instead of the normal output.

killall
Syntax
      killall [option(s)] [--] name ...

      killall -l

      killall -V,--version 

Options

   -e
   --exact  Require an exact match for very long names.
            If a command name is longer than 15 characters, the full name might be
            unavailable (i.e. it is swapped out). In this case, killall will kill everything
            that matches within the first 15 characters. With -e, such entries are skipped. 
            killall prints a message for each skipped entry if -v is specified in addition to -e, 

   -g
   --process-group
            Kill the process group to which the process belongs.
            The kill signal is only sent once per group, even if multiple processes belonging
            to the same process group were found.

   -I
   --ignore-case
            Do case insensitive process name match.
 
   -i
   --interactive
            Interactively ask for confirmation before killing.

   -l
   --list   List all known signal names.

   name     The command/process to be killed

   -q
   --quiet  Do not complain if no processes were killed.
     
   -r
   --regexp Interpret process name pattern as an extended regular expression.
     
   -s signal
   -signal
   --signal signal
            Send signal instead of the default SIGTERM. See list below.
            e.g. -s 9 = SIGKILL

   -u user
   --user user
            Kill only processes the specified user owns. Command names are optional.

   -v
   --verbose
            Report if the signal was successfully sent.

   -V
   --version
            Display version information.
   -w
   --wait   Wait for all killed processes to die. killall checks once per second if any
            of the killed processes still exist and only returns if none are left.
            Note that killall can wait forever if the signal was ignored, had no effect, or
            if the process stays in zombie state. 

   -Z pattern
   --context pattern 
            Specify security context: kill only processes having security context that match
            with given expended regular expression pattern. Must precede other arguments on
            the command line. Command names are optional. (SELinux Only)

   --       Each parameter after a '--' parameter is always interpreted as a non-option parameter.

             if no arguments are given, a list of the recognized commands.

     abort { all | printer }
             Terminate an active spooling daemon on the local host immediately
             and then disable printing (preventing new daemons from being
             started by lpr)  for the specified printers.

     clean { all | printer }
             Remove any temporary files, data files, and control files that
             cannot be printed (i.e., do not form a complete printer job) from
             the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.

     disable { all | printer }
             Turn the specified printer queues off.  This prevents new printer
             jobs from being entered into the queue by lpr.

              when this condition occurs.  If the user is the super-user,
             try to cancel the current daemon first (i.e., kill and restart a
             stuck daemon).

     start { all | printer }
             Enable printing and start a spooling daemon for the listed printers.

     status { all | printer }
             Display the status of daemons and queues on the local machine.

lpr
Syntax
      lpr [-Pprinter] [-#num] [-C class] [-J job] [-T title] [-U user] [-i [numcols]]
            [-1234 font] [-wnum] [-cdfghlnmprstv] [name ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Lpr uses a spooling daemon to print the named files when facilities become available.
     If no names appear, the standard input is assumed.

     The following single letter options are used to notify the line printer spooler
     that the files are not standard text files. The spooling daemon will use the
     appropriate filters to print the data accordingly.

     -c      The files are assumed to contain data produced by cifplot(1)

     -d      The files are assumed to contain data from tex (DVI format from
             Stanford).

     -f      Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as
             a standard FORTRAN carriage control character.

     -g      The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as produced
             by the plot routines (see also plot for the filters used by the
             printer spooler).

     -l      Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and
             suppresses page breaks.

     -n      The files are assumed to contain data from ditroff (device independent
              troff).

     -p      Use pr(1) to format the files (equivalent to print).

     -t      The files are assumed to contain data from troff(1) (cat photo-
             typesetter commands).

     -v      The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices like
             the Benson Varian.

     These options apply to the handling of the print job:

     -P      Force output to a specific printer.  Normally, the default printer
             is used (site dependent), or the value of the environment
             variable PRINTER is used.

     -h      Suppress the printing of the burst page.

     -m      Send mail upon completion.

     -r      Remove the file upon completion of spooling. Can not be used with
             the -s option, due to security concerns.

     -s      Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the spool directory.
               The -s option will use symlink(2) to link data files
             rather than trying to copy them so large files can be printed.
             This means the files should not be modified or removed until they
             have been printed.

     The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers:

     -#num   The quantity num is the number of copies desired of each file
             named.  For example,

                   lpr -#3 foo.c bar.c more.c

             would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3 copies
             of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand,

                   cat foo.c bar.c more.c | lpr -#3

             will give three copies of the concatenation of the files. Often a
             site will disable this feature to encourage use of a photocopier
             instead.

     -[1234]font
             Specifies a font to be mounted on font position i. The daemon
             will construct a .railmag file referencing the font pathname.

     -C class
             Job classification to use on the burst page.  For example,

                   lpr -C EECS foo.c

             causes the system name (the name returned by hostname(1))  to be
             replaced on the burst page by EECS, and the file foo.c to be printed.

     -J job  Job name to print on the burst page.  Normally, the first file's name is used.

     -T title
             Title name for pr(1),  instead of the file name.

     -U user
             User name to print on the burst page, also for accounting purposes.
             This option is only honored if the real user-id is daemon
             (or that specified in the printcap file instead of daemon), and
             is intended for those instances where print filters wish to requeue jobs.

     -i [numcols]
             The output is indented. If the next argument is numeric (numcols),
             it is used as the number of blanks to be printed before each line;
             otherwise, 8 characters are printed.

     -wnum   Uses num as the page width for pr(1).

Environment
     If the following environment variable exists, it is used by lpr:

     PRINTER  Specifies an alternate default printer.

Files
     /etc/passwd              Personal identification.
     /etc/printcap            Printer capabilities data base.
     /usr/sbin/lpd*           Line printer daemons.
     /var/spool/output/*      Directories used for spooling.
     /var/spool/output/*/cf*  Daemon control files.
     /var/spool/output/*/df*  Data files specified in "cf" files.
     /var/spool/output/*/tf*  Temporary copies of "cf" files.

Diagnostics
     If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.  Lpr will object
      to printing binary files.  If a user other than root prints a file
     and spooling is disabled, lpr will print a message saying so and will not
     put jobs in the queue.  If a connection to lpd(1) on the local machine
     cannot be made, lpr will say that the daemon cannot be started.  Diagnostics
     can be printed in the daemon's log file regarding missing spool
     files by lpd(1).

Bugs
     Fonts for troff(1) and tex reside on the host with the printer. It is
     currently not possible to use local font libraries.

********************

lprm
Syntax
      lprm [-Pprinter] [-] [job# ...] [user ...]

Options and arguments:

     -Pprinter
             Specify the queue associated with a specific printer (otherwise
             the default printer is used).

     -       If a single '-' is given, lprm will remove all jobs which a user
             owns.  If the super-user employs this flag, the spool queue will
             be emptied entirely.

     user    Causes lprm to attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to
             that user (or users).  This form of invoking lprm is useful only
             to the super-user.

     job#   A user can dequeue an individual job by specifying its job number.
            This number can be obtained from the lpq(1) program, e.g.

                   % lpq -l

                   1st:ken                         [job #013ucbarpa]
                           (standard input)        100 bytes
                   % lprm 13

     If neither arguments or options are given, lprm will delete the currently
     active job if it is owned by the user who invoked lprm.

     lprm announces the names of any files it removes and is silent if there
     are no jobs in the queue which match the request list.

     lprm will kill off an active daemon, if necessary, before removing any
     spooling files.  If a daemon is killed, a new one is automatically
     restarted upon completion of file removals.

Environment
     If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by lprm.

     PRINTER  If the environment variable PRINTER exists, and a printer has
              not been specified with the -P option, the default printer is
              assumed from PRINTER.

Files
     /etc/printcap       Printer characteristics file.
     /var/spool/*        Spooling directories.
     /var/spool/*/lock   Lock file used to obtain the pid of the current daemon
                         and the job number of the currently active job.

         on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express buses.
   -b   Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by the cards on the
        PCI bus instead of as seen by the kernel.
   -D   Always show PCI domain numbers. By default, lspci suppresses them on machines which have only domain 0.

   Options to control resolving ID's to names:

   -n   Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking them up in the PCI ID list.
   -nn  Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names.
   -q   Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a device is not found in the local pci.ids file.
        If the DNS query succeeds, the result is cached in ~/.pciids-cache and it is recognized in
        subsequent runs even if -q is not given any more. Please use this switch inside automated scripts
        only with caution to avoid overloading the database servers.
   -qq  Same as -q, but the local cache is reset.
   -Q   Query the central database even for entries which are recognized locally.
        Use this if you suspect that the displayed entry is wrong.

   Options for selection of devices:

   -s [[[[domain]:]bus]:][slot][.[func]]
           Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your machine has several host bridges,
           they can either share a common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI domain of
           its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7).
           Each component of the device address can be omitted or set to "*", both meaning "any value".
           All numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., "0:" means all devices on bus 0, "0" means all
           functions of device 0 on any bus, "0.3" selects third function of device 0 on  all buses
           and ".4" shows only the fourth function of each device. 
   -d [vendor]:[device]
           Show only devices with specified vendor and device ID. Both ID's are given in hexadecimal and
           may be omitted or given as "*", both meaning "any value". 

   Other options:

   -i file
           Use file as the PCI ID list instead of /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids. 
   -p file
           Use file as the map of PCI ID's handled by kernel modules.
           By default, lspci uses /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap.
           Applies only to Linux systems with recent enough module tools.

   -M   Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough scan of all PCI devices, including those behind
        misconfigured bridges, etc. This option gives meaningful results only with a direct hardware access
        mode, which usually requires root privileges. Please note that the bus mapper only scans PCI domain 0.
   --version
        Shows lspci version. This option should be used stand-alone. 

   PCI access options:

        The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices (see pcilib(7) for details).
        You can use the following options to influence its behavior:
   -A method
        The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI hardware.
        By default, it uses the first access method available, but you can use this option to override
        this decision. See -A help for a list of available methods and their descriptions. 
   -O param=value
        The behavior of the library is controlled by several named parameters.
        This option allows to set the value of any of the parameters.
        Use -O help for a list of known parameters and their default values.

   -H1  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)

   -H2  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)

   -F file
        Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of devices and values of their
        configuration registers from the given file produced by an earlier run of lspci -x.
        This is very useful for analysis of user-supplied bug reports, because you can display the hardware configuration
        in any way you want without disturbing the user with requests for more dumps. 

   -G   Increase debug level of the library.

********************

man / info / help
Syntax
      man [-acdfFhkKtwW] [--path] [-m system] [-p string] [-C config_file]
             [-M pathlist] [-P pager] [-B browser] [-H htmlpager] [-S section_list]
                [section] name ... 

Key:

   -C config_file  The configuration file to use; the default is /etc/man.config. (See man.config(5).) 

   -M path         The list of directories to search for man pages. Separate the directories with colons.
                   An empty list is the same as not specifying -M at all. See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES. 

   -P pager        Which pager to use. This option overrides the MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn
                   overrides the PAGER variable. By default, man uses /usr/bin/less -is. 

   -B              Which browser to use on HTML files. This option overrides the BROWSER environment variable.
                   By default, man uses /usr/bin/less-is,

   -H              Specify a command that renders HTML files as text. This option overrides the HTMLPAGER environment variable.
                   By default, man uses /bin/cat,

   -S section_list List is a colon separated list of manual sections to search. This option overrides the MANSECT environment variable.

   -a              By default, man will exit after displaying the first manual page it finds.
                   Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages that match name, not just the first.

   -c              Reformat the source man page, even when an up-to-date cat page exists.
                   This can be meaningful if the cat page was formatted for a screen with a different number of columns,
                   or if the preformatted page is corrupted.

   -d              Don't actually display the man pages, but do print gobs of debugging information.

   -D              Both display and print debugging info.

   -f              Equivalent to whatis.

   -F
   --preformat     Format only - do not display. 

   -h              Print a help message and exit.

   -k              Equivalent to apropos.

   -K              Search for the specified string in *all* man pages.
                   Warning: this can be very slow and can match multiple pages! It helps to specify a section.

   -m system       Specify an alternate set of man pages to search based on the system name given.

   -p string       Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff.
                   Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.
                   Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to designate
                   them: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).
                   This option overrides the MANROFFSEQ environment variable.

   -t              Use /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc to format the manual page, passing the output to stdout.
                   The default output format of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc is Postscript, refer to the
                   manual page of /usr/bin/groff -Tps -mandoc for ways to pick an alternate format.
                   Depending on the selected format and the availability of printing devices, the output may
                   need to be passed through some filter or another before being printed.

   -w
   --path          Don't actually display the man pages, but do print the location(s) of the files that
                   would be formatted or displayed. If no argument is given: display (on stdout) the list
                   of directories that is searched by man for man pages. If manpath is a link to man, then
                   "manpath" is equivalent to "man --path". 

   -W              Like -w, but print file names one per line, without additional information.
                   This is useful in shell commands like man -aW man | xargs ls -l 

Press [Space bar] or [return] to view the next page.

Press [q] to exit.MANPATH     If MANPATH is set, man uses it as the path to search for manual page files.
            It overrides the configuration file and the automatic search path, but is overridden by the -M invocation option.
            See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES. 
MANPL       If MANPL is set, its value is used as the display page length. Otherwise, the entire man page will occupy one (long) page.
MANROFFSEQ  If MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors run before running nroff or troff.
            By default, pages are passed through the tbl preprocessor before nroff. 
MANSECT     If MANSECT is set, its value is used to determine which manual sections to search. 
MANWIDTH    If MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the width manpages should be displayed.
            Otherwise the pages can be displayed over the whole width of your screen. 
MANPAGER    If MANPAGER is set, its value is used as the name of the program to use to display the man page.
            If not, then PAGER is used. If that has no value either, /usr/bin/less -is is used. 
BROWSER     The name of a browser to use for displaying HTML manual pages. If it is not set, /usr/bin/less -is is used. 
HTMLPAGER   The command to use for rendering HTML manual pages as text. If it is not set, /bin/cat is used. 
LANG        If LANG is set, its value defines the name of the subdirectory where man first looks for man pages.
            Thus, the command 'LANG=dk man 1 foo' will cause man to look for the foo man page in .../dk/man1/foo.1,
            and if it cannot find such a file, then in .../man1/foo.1, where ... is a directory on the search path.
NLSPATH, LC_MESSAGES, LANG
            The environment variables NLSPATH and LC_MESSAGES (or LANG when the latter does not exist) play a role in
            locating the message catalog. (But the English messages are compiled in, and for English no catalog is
            required.) Note that programs like col(1) called by man also use e.g. LC_CTYPE. 
PATH        PATH helps determine the search path for manual page files. See SEARCH PATH FOR MANUAL PAGES.
SYSTEM      SYSTEM is used to get the default alternate system name (for use with the -m option).

********************

mapfile
Syntax
      mapfile [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
    readarray [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]

Key
   -d    The first character of delim is used to terminate each input line, rather than newline.
         If delim is the empty string, mapfile will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character. 

   -n    Copy at most count lines. If count is 0, all lines are copied.

   -O    Begin assigning to array at index origin. The default index is 0.

   -s    Discard the first count lines read.

   -t    Remove a trailing newline from each line read.

   -u    Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.

   -C    Evaluate callback each time quantum lines are read. The -c option specifies quantum.

   -c    Specify the number of lines read between each call to callback.

********************

mkdir
Syntax
      mkdir [Options] folder...

      mkdir "Name with spaces"

Options
  -m, --mode=MODE   set permission mode (as in chmod), not rwxrwxrwx - umask
  -p, --parents     no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
      --verbose     print a message for each created directory

********************

mkfifo
Syntax
      mkfifo [options] NAME...

Options

 -m MODE
 --mode=MODE
      Set the mode of created FIFOs to MODE, which is symbolic as in
      'chmod' and uses 0666 (read and write allowed for everyone) minus
      the bits set in the umask for the point of departure.

********************

mkfile
Syntax
          mkfile [ -nv ] size[b|k|m|g] filename ...
Options
   -n     Create an empty filename.  The size is noted,  but  disk  blocks
          aren't allocated until data is written to them.

   -v     Verbose.  Report the names and sizes of created files.Example

  mkfile -n ~/newfile.txt

********************

mknod
Syntax
      mknod [options]... NAME Type [Major Minor]

Options

   -m MODE
   --mode=MODE
            Set the mode of created files to MODE, which is symbolic as in
            'chmod' and uses 0666 minus the bits set in the umask as the point of departure.

   Type     The type of file to make:
              'p'     for a FIFO
              'b'     for a block special file
              'c'     for a character special file

Major/Minor When making a block or character special file, the major and minor 
            device numbers must be given after the file type.

********************

mktemp
Syntax
      mktemp [-d] [-q] [-t prefix] [-u] template ...

      mktemp [-d] [-q] [-u] -t prefix

Options
   -d      Make a directory instead of a file.

   -q      Fail silently if an error occurs.
           This is useful if a script does not want error output to go to standard error.

   -t prefix
           Generate a template (using the supplied prefix and TMPDIR if set)
           to create a filename template.

   -u      Operate in ''unsafe'' mode.
           The temp file will be unlinked before mktemp exits.
           This is slightly better than mktemp(3) but still introduces a race condition.
           Use of this option is not encouraged.

********************

more
Syntax
      more [-dlfpcsu] [-num] [+/ pattern] [+ linenum] [file ...]

Options
     Command line options are described below.  Options are also taken from
     the environment variable MORE (make sure to precede them with a dash
     (''-'')) but command line options will override them.
 
     -num  This option specifies an integer which is the screen size (in lines).
 
     -d    More will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to continue,
           'q' to quit.]" and will display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]"
           instead of ringing the bell when an illegal key is pressed.
 
     -l    More usually treats ^L (form feed) as a special character, and will
           pause after any line that contains a form feed.  The -l option will
           prevent this behavior.
 
     -f    Causes more to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long lines are not folded).
 
     -p    Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display the text.
                     
     -c    Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing
           the remainder of each line as it is displayed.
 
     -s    Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.
 
     -u    Suppress underlining.
 
     +/    The +/ option specifies a string that will be searched for before
           each file is displayed.
 
     +num  Start at line number num.
 
COMMANDS
     Interactive commands for more are based on vi(1).  Some commands can be
     preceeded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions below.  In
     the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
 
     h or ?      Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all  
                 the other commands, remember this one.
 
     SPACE       Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen
                 size.
 
     z           Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen
                 size.  Argument becomes new default.
 
     RETURN      Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to 1.
                 Argument becomes new default.
 
     d or ^D     Scroll k lines.  Default is current scroll size, initially
                 11.  Argument becomes new default.
 
     q or Q or INTERRUPT    Exits the more command.
           
     s           Skip forward k lines of text.  Defaults to 1.
 
     f           Skip forward k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.
 
     b or ^B     Skip backwards k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.
 
     '           Go to place where previous search started.
 
     =           Display current line number.
 
     /pattern    Search for kth occurrence of regular expression. Defaults to 1.
 
     n           Search for kth occurrence of last r.e.  Defaults to 1.
 
     ! or :!     Execute  in a subshell           
         
     v           Start up /usr/bin/vi at current line
 
     ^L          Redraw screen
 
     :n          Go to kth next file.  Defaults to 1.
 
     :p          Go to kth previous file.  Defaults to 1.
 
     :f          Display current file name and line number
 
     .           Repeat previous command
 
ENVIRONMENT
     More utilizes the following environment variables, if they exist:
 
     MORE        This variable can be set with favored options to more.
     SHELL       Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login

********************

most
Syntax
      most [-1bCckMstvwz] [+lineno] [+c] [+d] [+s] [+/string] [filename...] 

Key
   -1  VT100 mode. This is meaningful only on VMS systems.
       This option should be used if the terminal is strictly a VT100.
       This implies that the terminal does not have the ability to delete and
       insert multiple lines. VT102s and above have this ability.

   -b  Binary mode. Use this switch when you want to view files containing
       8 bit characters. most will display the file 16 bytes per line in
       hexidecimal notation. A typical line looks like:
         01000000 40001575 9C23A020 4000168D ....@..u.#. @... 
       When used with the -v option, the same line looks like:

         ^A^@^@^@  @^@^U u 9C #A0    @^@^V8D     ....@..u.#. @...

   -k  'Kanji' option. Ordinarily, most will go into binary mode if the file
       consists of non-ascii characters. Sometimes this feature is not
       desirable since some terminals have a special interpretation for
       eight bit characters. The -k option turns off the automatic sensing.

   -C  Disable color support.

   -M  Disable the use of mmap.

   -s  Squeeze. Replace multiple blank lines with a single blank line.

   -z  option turns off gunzip-on-the-fly.

   -v  Display control characters as in '^A' for control A.
       Normally most does not interpret control characters.

   -t  Display tabs as '^I'. This option is meaningful only when used
       with the -v option. +lineno Start up at lineno.

   +c  Make search case sensitive. By default, they are not.

   +d  This switch should only be used if you want the option to delete
       a file while viewing it. This makes it easier to clean unwanted
       files out of a directory. The file is deleted with the interactive
       key sequence ':D' and then confirming with 'y'.

   +/string
       Start up at the line containing the first occurrence of string.

mount
SYNTAX
       mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t vfstype]

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-o options [,...]] device | dir

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir

       mount [-hV]OPTIONS

       -a     Mount  all  filesystems  (of  the given types) mentioned in fstab.

       -F     (Used in conjunction with  -a.)   Fork  off  a  new incarnation of mount
              for each device.  This will do the mounts on different devices
              or  different NFS servers in parallel.
              This has the advantage that it is faster; also NFS timeouts go in  parallel. 
              A disadvantage is that the mounts are done in undefined order.
              Thus, you cannot use this option if you want to mount both /usr and /usr/spool.

       -f     Causes  everything to be done except for the actual system call;
              if it's not  obvious, this 'fakes' mounting the file system.
              This option is useful in conjunction with the -v flag to determine what
              the mount command is trying to do. It can also be used to add entries for devices
              that were mounted  earlier with the -n option.

       -n     Mount without writing in /etc/mtab.
              This is necessary for example when /etc is on a read-only file system.

       -s     Tolerate  sloppy mount options rather than failing.
              This option exists for support of the Linux autofs-based automounter.

       -r     Mount  the  file  system read-only. A synonym is -o ro

       -w     Mount the  file  system  read/write.  This is the default. A synonym is -o rw.

       -L label
              Mount the partition that has the specified label.

       -U uuid
              Mount  the  partition  that has the specified uuid.

       -o     Several -o options can be specified in a comma separated string ...
              see info for more.

              async  All  I/O  to  the file system should be done asynchronously.

              atime  Update inode access time  for  each  access.
                     This is the default.

              noatime
                     Do  not  update  inode  access times on this file system
                     (e.g, for faster access  on  the news spool to speed up news servers).

              auto   Can be mounted with the -a option.

              noauto Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the -a option will not cause the
                     file system to  be mounted).

              ro     Mount the file system read-only.

              rw     Mount the file system read-write.

              suid   Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.

              sync   All  I/O  to  the file system should be done synchronously.

       -t vfstype
              The  argument  following the -t is used to indicate the file system type.

       -h     Print a help message.

       -V     Output version.

       -v     Verbose mode.

        [--curses] [--split] [--raw] [--no-dns] [--gtk] [--address IP.ADD.RE.SS]
           [--interval SECONDS] [--psize BYTES | -s BYTES] HOSTNAME [PACKETSIZE]

Key
   -c COUNT
   --report-cycles COUNT
       Use this option to set the number of pings sent to determine both the machines on the network and
       the reliability of those machines. Each cycle lasts one second.

   -s BYTES
   --psize BYTES
   PACKETSIZE
       These options or a trailing PACKETSIZE on the commandline set the packet size (in Bytes
       inclusive IP and ICMP headers) used for probing.
       If set to a negative number, every iteration will use a different, random packetsize up to that number. 

   -g
   --gtk
       Force mtr to use the GTK+ based X11 window interface (if available). GTK+ must have
       been available on the system when mtr was built for this to work. See GTK+

   -p
   --split
       Set mtr to spit out a format that is suitable for a split-user interface.

   -h
   --help
       Print a summary of command line argument options. 

   -l
   --raw
       Tell mtr to use the raw output format. This format is better suited for archival of the
       measurement results. It could be parsed to be presented into any of the other display methods. 

   -a IP.ADD.RE.SS
   --address IP.ADD.RE.SS
       Bind outgoing packets' socket to a specific interface, so that any packet will be sent
       through this interface. NOTE that this option doesn't apply to DNS requests (which
       could be and could not be what you want). 

   -i SECONDS
   --interval SECONDS
       Use this option to specify the positive number of seconds between ICMP ECHO requests.
       The default value for this parameter is one second. 

   -t
   --curses
       Force mtr to use the curses based terminal interface (if available). 

   -n
   --no-dns
       Force mtr to display numeric IP numbers and not try to resolve the host names. 

   -r
   --report
       Put mtr into report mode. When in this mode, mtr will run for the number of cycles specified by
       the -c option, and then print statistics and exit. 
       This mode is useful for generating statistics about network quality.
       Note that each running instance of mtr generates a significant amount of network traffic.
       Using mtr to measure the quality of your network can result in decreased network performance.

   -v
   --version
       Print the installed version of mtr.

   -4  Use IPv4 only. 

   -6  Use IPv6 only.

mmv
Syntax
      mmv [Source_Option] [-h] [-d|p] [-g|t] [-v|n] [--] [from to] 

Options:

   -d   Delete
   -p   Protect (don't delete or overwrite)
   -g   Go
   -t   Terminate
   -n   no-execute mode (display messages about what would have been done)
   -v   verbose mode
   -h   help

Source_Options:

   -m   Move source file to target name. 
        Both must be on the same device. Will not move directories.
        If the source file is a symbolic link, moves the link without checking
        if the link's target from the new directory is different than the old.

   -x   same as -m, except cross-device moves are done by copying, then deleting source.
        When copying, sets the permission bits and file modification time of the target
        file to that of the source file.

   -r   Rename source file or directory to target name.
        The target name must not include a path: the file remains in the same directory
        in all cases. This option is the only way of renaming directories under mmv.

   -c   Copy source file to target name.
        Sets the file modification time and permission bits of the target file to that
        of the source file, regardless of whether the target file already exists.
        Chains and cycles (to be explained below) are not allowed.

   -o   Overwrite target name with source file.
        If target file exists, it is overwritten, keeping its original owner and
        permission bits. If it does not exist, it is created, with read-write permission
        bits set according to umask, and the execute permission bits copied from the
        source file. In either case, the file modification time is set to the current time.

   -a   Append contents of source file to target name.
        Target file modification time is set to the current time. If target file does not
        exist, it is created with permission bits set as under -o.
        Unlike all other options, -a allows multiple source files to have the same target name,
        e.g. "mmv -a \*.c big" will append all ".c" files to "big".
        Chains and cycles are also allowed, so "mmv -a f f" will double up "f".

   -l   Link target name to source file.
        Both must be on the same device, and the source must not be a directory.
        Chains and cycles are not allowed.

   -s   Same as -l, but use symbolic links instead of hard links.
        For the resulting link to aim back at the source, either the source name
        must begin with a '/', or the target must reside in either the current or the
        source directory. If none of these conditions are met, the link is refused.
        However, source and target can reside on different devices, and the source can be a directory. 

   If no source_option is specified, the task is given by the command name under which mmv was invoked (argv[0]):
 
   command_name   default task
 
   mmv            -x (Move except cross device)
   mcp            -c (Copy)
   mad            -a (Append)
   mln            -l (Link)

Options need not be given separately, i.e. "mmv -mk" is allowed.

               [-x proxy_address[:port]] [hostname] [port[s]]

Options
   -4      Use IPv4 addresses only.

   -6      Use IPv6 addresses only.

   -A      Set SO_RECV_ANYIF on socket. **

   -b boundif
           The interface to bind the socket to.

   -c      Send CRLF as line-ending. **

   -C      Force nc not to use cellular data context. **

   -d      Do not attempt to read from stdin.
           This will prevent any text being sent from a client to the server.

   -D      Enable debugging on the socket.

   -h      Print help.

   -i interval
           Specifies a delay time interval between lines of text sent and received.
           Also causes a delay time between connections to multiple ports.

   -G conntimeout
           TCP connection timeout in seconds.

   -H keepidle
           Initial TCP keep alive timeout in seconds.

   -I keepintvl
           Interval for repeating TCP keep alive timeouts in seconds.

   -J keepcnt
           Number of times to repeat TCP keep alive packets.

   -k      Force nc to stay listening for another connection after its current
           connection is completed.  It is an error to use this option
           without the -l option.

   -l      Listen for an incoming connection rather than initiate a connection
           to a remote host.  It is an error to use this option in conjunction 
           with the -p, -s, or -z options.
           Additionally, any timeouts specified with the -w option are ignored.

   -L num_probes
           Number of probes to send to the peer before declaring that the
           peer is not reachable and generating an adpative timeout
           read/write event.

   -n      Skip all DNS or service lookups on addresses, hostnames or ports.

   -p source_port
           Specify the source port nc should use, subject to privilege
           restrictions and availability.  It is an error to use this option
           in conjunction with the -l option.

   -r      Select the source and/or destination ports randomly instead of
           sequentially within a range or in the order that the system assigns them.

   -s source_ip_address
           The IP of the interface which is used to send the packets.
           It is an error to use this option in conjunction with the -l option.

   -S      Enables the RFC 2385 TCP MD5 signature option. **

   -t      Send RFC 854 DON'T and WON'T responses to RFC 854 DO and WILL requests.
           This makes it possible to use nc to script telnet sessions.

   -T ToS  Specifies IP Type of Service (ToS) for the connection.
           Valid values are the tokens 'lowdelay', 'throughput', 'reliability', or
           an 8-bit hexadecimal value preceded by '0x'. **

   -U      Use Unix Domain Sockets.

   -u      Use UDP instead of the default option of TCP.

   -v      Give more verbose output.

   -w timeout
           If a connection and stdin are idle for more than timeout seconds,
           then the connection is silently closed.  The -w flag has no
           effect on the -l option, i.e. nc will listen forever for a con-
           nection, with or without the -w flag.  The default is no timeout.

   -X proxy_version
           Requests that nc should use the specified protocol when talking
           to the proxy server.  Supported protocols are '4' (SOCKS v.4),
           '5' (SOCKS v.5) and 'connect' (HTTPS proxy).  If the protocol
           is not specified, SOCKS version 5 is used.

   -x proxy_address[:port]
           Connect to hostname using a proxy at proxy_address and port.
           If port is not specified, the well-known port for the proxy 
           protocol is used (1080 for SOCKS, 3128 for HTTPS).

   -z      Just scan for listening daemons, without sending any data to them.
           It is an error to use this option in conjunction with the -l option.$ nc localhost 25 << EOF

         [--inet|--ip] [--ax25] [--ipx] [--netrom] [--ddp](none)         By default, netstat displays a list of open sockets.
                If you don't specify any address families, then the active sockets of all
                configured address families will be printed.
 --route , -r   Display the kernel routing tables.
 --groups , -g  Display multicast group membership information for IPv4 and IPv6.
 --interfaces=iface , -I=iface , -i
                Display a table of all network interfaces, or the specified iface.
 --masquerade , -M
                Display a list of masqueraded connections.
 --statistics , -s
                Display summary statistics for each protocol.

Options
 --verbose , -v   Tell the user what is going on by being verbose. Especially print some useful
                  information about unconfigured address families.
 --numeric , -n   Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host, port or user names.

 --numeric-hosts  Shows numerical host addresses but does not affect the resolution of port or user names.
 --numeric-ports  Shows numerical port numbers but does not affect the resolution of host or user names.
 --numeric-users  Shows numerical user IDs but does not affect the resolution of host or port names.

 --protocol=family , -A
                  Specifies the address families (perhaps better described as low level protocols) for
                  which connections are to be shown. family is a comma (',') separated list of address
                  family keywords like inet, unix, ipx, ax25, netrom, and ddp.
                  This has the same effect as using the --inet, --unix (-x), --ipx, --ax25, --netrom, and --ddp options.
                  The address family inet includes raw, udp and tcp protocol sockets.

 -c, --continuous This will cause netstat to print the selected information every second continuously.
 -e, --extend     Display additional information. Use this option twice for maximum detail.
 -o, --timers     Include information related to networking timers.

 -p, --program    Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
 -l, --listening  Show only listening sockets. (These are omitted by default.)
 -a, --all        Show both listening and non-listening (for TCP this means established connections) sockets.
                  With the --interfaces option, show interfaces that are not marked.

 -f               Print routing information from the FIB. (This is the default.)
 -c               Print routing information from the route cache.
 -Z --context     If SELinux enabled print SELinux context.
 -T --notrim      Stop trimming long addresses.

 delay            Netstat will cycle printing through statistics every delay seconds. UP.Proto            The protocol (tcp, udp, raw) used by the socket.
 Recv-Q           The count of bytes not copied by the user program connected to this socket.
 Send-Q           The count of bytes not acknowledged by the remote host. 

 Local Address    Address and port number of the local end of the socket. Unless the --numeric (-n)
                  option is specified, the socket address is resolved to its canonical host name (FQDN),
                  and the port number is translated into the corresponding service name.

 Foreign Address  Address and port number of the remote end of the socket. Analogous to "Local Address."

 State            The state of the socket.
                  Since there are no states in raw mode and usually no states used in UDP, this column
                  may be left blank. Normally this can be one of several values:

                     ESTABLISHED The socket has an established connection. 
                     SYN_SENT    The socket is actively attempting to establish a connection. 
                     SYN_RECV    A connection request has been received from the network. 
                     FIN_WAIT1   The socket is closed, and the connection is shutting down. 
                     FIN_WAIT2   Connection is closed, and the socket is waiting for a shutdown from the remote end. 
                     TIME_WAIT   The socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the network. 
                     CLOSED      The socket is not being used. 
                     CLOSE_WAIT  The remote end has shut down, waiting for the socket to close. 
                     LAST_ACK    The remote end has shut down, and the socket is closed. Waiting for acknowledgement. 
                     LISTEN      The socket is listening for incoming connections.
                                 Such sockets are not included in the output unless you specify the --listening (-l) or --all (-a) option. 
                     CLOSING     Both sockets are shut down but we still don't have all our data sent. 
                     UNKNOWN     The state of the socket is unknown.

 User             The username or the user id (UID) of the owner of the socket.

 PID/Program name Slash-separated pair of the process id (PID) and process name of the process that
                  owns the socket. --program causes this column to be included.
                  You will also need superuser privileges to see this information on sockets you don't own.
                  This identification information is not yet available for IPX sockets.

 Timer            (this needs to be written)Proto            The protocol (usually unix) used by the socket.
 RefCnt           The reference count (i.e. attached processes via this socket).
 Flags            The flags displayed is SO_ACCEPTON (displayed as ACC), SO_WAITDATA (W) or SO_NOSPACE (N).
                  SO_ACCECPTON is used on unconnected sockets if their corresponding processes are waiting for a connect request.
                  The other flags are not of normal interest.

 State            This field will contain one of the following Keywords:

                     FREE       The socket is not allocated 
                     LISTENING  The socket is listening for a connection request.
                                Such sockets are only included in the output if you specify the --listening (-l) or --all (-a) option. 
                     CONNECTING The socket is about to establish a connection. 
                     CONNECTED  The socket is connected. 
                     DISCONNECTING    The socket is disconnecting. 
                     (empty)    The socket is not connected to another one. 
                     UNKNOWN    This state should never happen.

 PID/Program name   Process ID (PID) and process name of the process that has the socket open.
                    More info available in Active Internet connections section written above.
 Path               This is the path name as which the corresponding processes attached to the socket. 
 Active IPX sockets
 Active NET/ROM sockets
 Active AX.25 sockets

                    print notifications just like nft monitor.

   -I, --includepath directory
                    Add the directory directory to the list of directories to be searched for included files.
                    This option may be specified multiple times.

   -f, --file filename  Read input from filename. If filename is -, read from stdin.
                        nft scripts must start #!/usr/sbin/nft -f

   -i, --interactive    Read input from an interactive readline CLI.
                        You can use quit to exit, or use the EOF marker, normally this is CTRL-D.

   -h, --help       Show help message and all options.

   -v, --version    Show version.define int_if1 = eth0
define int_if2 = eth1
define int_ifs = { $int_if1, $int_if2 }

filter input iif $int_ifs acceptlist   Print the ruleset in human-readable format.
flush  Clear the whole ruleset. Note that unlike iptables, this will remove all tables and whatever they contain,
       effectively leading to an empty ruleset - no packet filtering will happen anymore, so the kernel accepts
       any valid packet it receives.

Options

   -b STYLE
   --body-numbering=STYLE
       Select the numbering style for lines in the body section of each logical page.
       When a line is not numbered, the current line number is not incremented,
       but the line number separator character is still prepended to the line.

       The styles are:
         'a'        Number all lines,
         't'        Number only nonempty lines (default for body),
         'n'        Do not number lines (default for header and footer),
         'pREGEXP'  Number only lines that contain a match for REGEXP.

   -d CD
   --section-delimiter=CD
       Set the section delimiter characters to CD; default is '\:'. If only C is given,
       the second remains ':'.  (Remember to protect '\' or other metacharacters
       from shell expansion with quotes or extra backslashes.)

   -f STYLE
   --footer-numbering=STYLE
       Analogous to '--body-numbering'.

   -h STYLE
   --header-numbering=STYLE
       Analogous to '--body-numbering'.

   -i NUMBER
   --page-increment=NUMBER
       Increment line numbers by NUMBER (default 1).

   -l NUMBER
   --join-blank-lines=NUMBER
       Consider NUMBER (default 1) consecutive empty lines to be one logical line
       for numbering, and only number the last one.
       Where fewer than NUMBER consecutive empty lines occur, do not number them.
       An empty line is one that contains no characters, not even spaces or tabs.

   -n FORMAT
   --number-format=FORMAT
       Select the line numbering format (default is 'rn'):

      'ln'     left justified, no leading zeros;
      'rn'     right justified, no leading zeros;
      'rz'     right justified, leading zeros.

   -p
   --no-renumber
       Do not reset the line number at the start of a logical page.

   -s STRING
   --number-separator=STRING
       Separate the line number from the text line in the output with STRING
       (default is the TAB character).

   -v NUMBER
   --starting-line-number=NUMBER
       Set the initial line number on each logical page to NUMBER (default 1).

   -w NUMBER
   --number-width=NUMBER
       Use NUMBER characters for line numbers e.g.000064 (default 6).

nslookup
Syntax:
       nslookup

       nslookup host-to-find 

       nslookup server 

   nslookup is deprecated; its functionality is replaced by the dig and host commands.
   nslookup may not be included in some distributions.

interactive mode:

       nslookup -server 

       nslookup [-options] [host-to-find ]

Options:

   host [server]
         Look up information for host using the current default server or using server,
         if specified. If host is an Internet address and the query type is A or PTR ,
         the name of the host is returned. If host is a name and does not have a trailing
         period, the default domain name is appended to the name. (This behavior depends
         on the state of the set options domain , srchlist , defname , and search.

         To look up a host not in the current domain, append a period to the name.

   server domain
   lserver domain
         Change the default server to domain ; lserver uses the initial server to look up
         information about domain while server uses the current default server.
         If an authoritative answer can't be found, the names of servers that might have 
         the answer are returned. 
   root
         Change the default server to the server for the root of the domain name space.
         Currently, the host ns.internic.net is used. (This command is a synonym for
          'lserver ns.internic.net' The name of the root server can be changed with
         the 'set root ' command. 

   finger [name] [> filename ] 
   finger [name] [>> filename ]
          Connects with the finger server on the current host. The current host is
          defined when a previous lookup for a host was successful and returned address
          information (see the 'set querytype=A ' command). The name is optional. > and
          >> can be used to redirect output in the usual manner.

   ls [option ] domain [> filename ]
   ls [option ] domain [>> filename ]
          List the information available for domain , optionally creating or appending
          to filename The default output contains host names and their Internet addresses.
          Option can be one of the following:

             -t querytype  list all records of the specified type (see querytype below). 
             -a            list aliases of hosts in the domain; synonym for '-t CNAME ' 
             -d            list all records for the domain; synonym for '-t ANY' 
             -h            list CPU and operating system information for the domain; synonym for '-t HINFO' 
             -s            list well-known services of hosts in the domain; synonym for '-t WKS'

          When output is directed to a file, hash marks are printed for every 50 records
          received from the server. 

   view filename
          Sort and lists the output of previous ls command(s) with more(1). 

   set keyword [= value ]          This command is used to change state information that affects the lookups.
          run man nslookup for a full list of valid keywords.

   set all   Print the current value of the frequently-used options
             to set Information about the current default server and host is also printed.

   help
   ?      Print a brief summary of commands. 

   exit   Exit the program.

passwd
SYNTAX
      passwd [Options...] [LOGIN]

OPTIONS
   -a, --all
      This option can be used only with -S and causes show status for all users.

   -d, --delete
      Delete a user's password (make it empty). This is a quick way to disable
      a password for an account. It will set the named account passwordless.

   -e, --expire
      Immediately expire an account's password. This in effect can force a
      user to change their password at the user's next login.

   -h, --help
      Display help message and exit.

   -i, --inactive INACTIVE
      This option is used to disable an account after the password has been
      expired for a number of days. After a user account has had an expired
      password for INACTIVE days, the user may no longer sign on to the account.

   -k, --keep-tokens
      Indicate password change should be performed only for expired authentication
      tokens (passwords). The user wishes to keep their non-expired tokens as before.

   -l, --lock
      Lock the password of the named account. This option disables a  password by
      changing it to a value which matches no possible encrypted value
      (it adds a ´!´ at the beginning of the password).

      Note that this does not disable the account. The user may still be able to
      login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key).
      To disable the account, administrators should use usermod --expiredate 1
      (this set the account's expire date to Jan 2, 1970).

      Users with a locked password are not allowed to change their password.

   -n, --mindays MIN_DAYS
      Set the minimum number of days between password changes to MIN_DAYS.
      A value of zero for this field indicates that the user may change their
      password at any time.

   -q, --quiet
      Quiet mode.

   -r, --repository REPOSITORY
      change password in REPOSITORY repository

   -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
      Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration files
      from the CHROOT_DIR directory.

   -S, --status
      Display account status information. The status information consists of
      7 fields. The first field is the user's login name.
      The second field indicates if the user account has a locked password (L),
      has no password (NP), or has a usable password (P).
      The third field gives the date of the last password change. The next four
      fields are the minimum age, maximum age, warning period, and inactivity period
      for the password. These ages are expressed in days.

   -u, --unlock
      Unlock the password of the named account. This option re-enables a password
      by changing the password back to its previous value (to the value before using -l).

   -w, --warndays WARN_DAYS
      Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required.
      The WARN_DAYS option is the number of days prior to the  password expiring
      that a user will be warned that their password is about to expire.

   -x, --maxdays MAX_DAYS
      Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid. After MAX_DAYS, the 
      password is required to be changed.

      Passing the number -1 as MAX_DAYS will remove checking a password's validity.

paste
Syntax
      paste [options]... [file]...

Options
   -s
   --serial
        Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one line from each file.

   -d DELIM-LIST
   --delimiters DELIM-LIST
        Consecutively use the characters in DELIM-LIST instead of TAB to
        separate merged lines.
        When DELIM-LIST is exhausted, start again at its beginning.

ping
Syntax      ping [options] [ hop ...] destination_host

Options

   -a         Audible ping. This removes the need to look at the ping output.

   -A         Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, 
              so that effectively not more than one (or more, if preload is set) unanswered probes
              present in the network. Minimal interval is 200msec for not super-user.
              On networks with low rtt this mode is essentially equivalent to flood mode. 

   -b         Allow pinging a broadcast address. 

   -B         Do not allow ping to change source address of probes. The address is bound to one selected when ping starts.

   -c count   Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.

   -d         Debug, Set the SO_DEBUG option on the socket being used.

   -F flow_label  Allocate and set 20 bit flow label on echo request packets. (Only ping6).
                  If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow label.

   -f         Flood ping, output packets as fast as they come back or 100 times per second.

   -i wait    Set an interval of wait seconds between sending each packet. default=one second.
              Only super-user can set wait to values less 0.2 seconds.
              (incompatible with -f)

   -I interface address              Set source address to specified interface_address.
              Argument can be numeric IP address or name of device.
              Required when pinging an IPv6 link-local address.

   -l preload If preload is specified, ping sends that many packets as fast as
              possible before falling into its normal mode of behavior.
              Only the super-user can select preload more than 3.

   -L         Suppress loopback of multicast packets.
              only applies if the ping destination is a multicast address.

   -n         Numeric output only. No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic
              names for host addresses.
   -p pattern
              Specify up to 16 'pad' bytes to fill out the packet sent.
              This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a
              network. eg, '-p ff' will fill the packet sent with all ones.

   -q         Quiet output. Only display the summary lines at startup time and when finished.
 
   -Q tos     Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams. tos can be a decimal or hex number.
              Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. For detail see RFC1349 and RFC2474

   -R         Record route(IPv4 only). Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in the ECHO_REQUEST packet and
              display the route buffer on returned packets.
              Note that the IP header is only large enough for nine such routes.
              Many hosts ignore or discard this option.
 
   -r         Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
              If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
              This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it
              (e.g., after the interface was dropped by routed(8)).

   -s packetsize
              The number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into
              64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.

   -S sndbuf  Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected to buffer not more than one packet. 
   -t ttl     Set the IP Time to Live. 
   -T timestamp_option              Set special IP timestamp options, either 'tsonly' (only timestamps),
              'tsandaddr' (timestamps and addresses)
              or 'tsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]]' (timestamp prespecified hops). 
   -M hint    Select Path MTU Discovery strategy. hint can be either 'do' (prohibit fragmentation,
              even local one), 'want' (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size is large),
              or 'dont' (do not set DF flag). 
   -U         Print full user-to-user latency (the old behaviour).
              Normally ping prints network round trip time, which can be different f.e. due to DNS failures.

   -v         Verbose output. ICMP packets other than ECHO_RESPONSE that are received are listed.

   -w deadline
              A timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received.
              In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire
              or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from the network.

   -W timeout
              Time to wait for a response, in seconds.
              This option affects only the ICMP timeout in the absense of any responses, otherwise ping waits for two RTTs.

              The corresponding argument is an integer representing the number of seconds since the epoch.
              Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2 represents
              the time the shell was invoked.
              If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been given.
              This is an exception to the usual printf behavior. 

       %s     Character string char

       and  all C format specifications ending with one of diouxXfeEgGcs, with
       ARGUMENTs converted to proper type first.  Variable widths are handled.

********************

ps
Syntax
         ps option(s)-A         Select all processes, including those of other users.
   -a         Select all processes except both session leaders (see getsid(2)) and
              processes not associated with a terminal.
    a         Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is imposed upon
              the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are
              used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.

   -d         Select all processes except session leaders.
   --deselect Negate selection.
   -e         Select all processes, including those of other users.

    g         Really all, even session leaders. This flag is obsolete and may be
              discontinued in a future release.
   -N         Negate selection.
    r         Restrict output to running processes
    T         Select all processes associated with this terminal.
              Identical to the t option without any argument.
    x         Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is imposed upon
              the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are
              used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.-C cmdlist      Select by Command name, processes whose executable name is in cmdlist.
                   The command name is not the same as the command line.
                   Previous versions of procps and the kernel truncated this
                   command name to 15 characters. This limitation is no longer
                   present in both. If you depended on matching only 15 characters,
                   you may no longer get a match.

   -g grplist      Select by session OR by effective group name.
                   This ps will select by session when the list is completely numeric
                   (as sessions are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group
                   names are also specified. 

   --group grplist Select by effective group ID (EGID) or Name.
                   The effective group ID describes the group whose file access
                   permissions are used by the process (see getegid(2)).
                   The -g option is often an alternative to --group.

   -G grplist      Select by Real Group ID (RGID) or Name.
   --Group grplist Select by Real Group ID (RGID) or Name.

   -p pidlist      Select by process ID (PID)
   --pid pidlist   Select by process ID (PID)
    p pidlist      Select by process ID (PID)

   --ppid pidlist  Select by parent process ID.
                   This selects the processes with a parent process ID
                   in pidlist. That is, it selects processes that are
                   children of those listed in pidlist.

   --quick-pid pidlist  Select by process ID (quick mode).
    q pidlist      Select by process ID (quick mode).
                      Quick mode doesn't apply additional filtering rules.
                      The order of pids is unsorted and preserved.
                      No additional selection options, sorting and forest type
                      listings are allowed in this mode. 

   -s sesslist     Select by session ID.
   --sid sesslist  Select by session ID.

   -t ttylist      Select by terminal (tty)
   --tty ttylist   Select by terminal (tty)
                      Terminals (ttys, or screens for text output) can be
                      specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.
                      A plain "-" may be used to select processes not attached
                      to any terminal.

    t ttylist      Select by tty. Nearly identical to -t and --tty,
                   but can also be used with an empty ttylist to indicate
                   the terminal associated with ps.
                   Using the T option (Simple Process Selection above) is
                   considered cleaner than using T with an empty ttylist.


   -U userlist     Select by Real User ID (RUID) or Name.
   --User userlist Select by Real User ID (RUID) or Name. (Same as -U)
                   The real user ID identifies the user who created the process.

   -u userlist     Select by effective user ID (EUID) or Name.
   --user userlist Select by effective user ID (EUID) or Name.
    U userlist     Select by effective user ID (EUID) or Name.
                   The effective user ID describes the user whose file access
                   permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)

   -123      implied --sid
   123       implied --pid-c         Different scheduler info for -l option.
   -F         Extra Full listing. See the -f option, which -F implies.
   -f         Full-format listing.
              This can be combined with many other UNIX-style options to add
              additional columns. It also causes the command arguments to be
              printed. When used with -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP
              (thread ID) columns will be added. See the c option, the format
              keyword args, and the format keyword comm.

  --format format
              user-defined format.  Identical to -o and o.

   -j         Jobs format.
    j         BSD job control format.
   -l         Long format. The -y option is often useful with this.
    l         Display BSD long format.

   -M         Add a column of security data.  Identical to Z (for SELinux).

    O format  Is preloaded o (overloaded).
              The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with
              some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
              Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.
              To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting),
              specify the option in some other way (e.g. with -O or --sort).
              When used as a formatting option, it is identical to -O, with the BSD
              personality.

   -O format  is like -o, but preloaded with some default columns.
              Identical to -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command
                       or  -o pid,format,tname,time,cmd,  see -o below.

   -o format  Display in a user-defined format (space or comma separated).
   --format   Display in a user-defined format (space or comma separated).
    o format  Display in a user-defined format (space or comma separated).
                 Headers may be renamed (ps -o pid, ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as desired.
                 If all column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o comm=) then the header line
                 will not be output.  Column width will increase as needed for wide headers;
                 this may be used to widen up columns such as
                 WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm).  Explicit width control
                 (ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is offered too.  The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y
                 varies with personality; output may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two
                 columns named "X" and "Y".  Use multiple -o options when in doubt.
                 Use the PS_FORMAT environment variable to specify a default as desired;
                 DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or
                 BSD columns.

    s         Display signal format.
    u         Display user-oriented format.
    v         Display virtual memory format.
    X         Register format.
   -y         Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.
              This option can only be used with -l.
    Z         Add a column of security data.  Identical to -M (for SELinux).c              Show the true command name.
                  This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than
                  from the argv value.  Command arguments and any modifications to them
                  are thus not shown. This option effectively turns the args format
                  keyword into the comm format keyword; it is useful with the -f format
                  option and with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally
                  display the command arguments.  See the -f option, the format keyword
                  args, and the format keyword comm.
   --cols n       Set screen width.
   --columns n    Set screen width.
   --cumulative   Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).

    e             show environment after the command.
    f             ASCII-art process hierarchy (forest).
   --forest       ASCII art process tree.

    h             No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).
   -H             Show process hierarchy (forest).
   --headers      Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

    k spec        Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
                  [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the
                  STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS.  The "+" is optional since
                  default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.
                  Identical to --sort.

                      Examples:
                      ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid
                      ps axk comm o comm,args
                      ps kstart_time -ef

   --lines        Set screen height.
   -m  m          Show all threads.
   -n             Set namelist file.
   --no-headers   Print no header line at all.--no-heading is an alias for this option.

    n             Numeric output for WCHAN and USER.

    O order       sorting order (overloaded).
                  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some
                  common fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
                  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.
                  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting),
                  specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).

   --rows n       Set screen height.

    S             Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes
                  into their parent. This is useful for examining a system where a parent
                  process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to do work.

   --sort         Specify sorting order.
                  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].
                  Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS.
                  The "+" is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or
                  lexicographic order.  Identical to k.
                  For example: ps jax --sort=uid,-ppid, +pid

   -w             Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.
    w             Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.
   --width n      Set screen width.H    Show threads as if they were processes.
   -L    Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.
    m    Show threads after processes.
   -m    Show threads after processes.
   -T    Show threads, possibly with SPID column.--help    Print help message.
   --info    Print debugging info.
    L        List all format specifiers.
   --version Print version.
   -V        Print version.
    V        Print version.PROCESS FLAGS
  The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is
  provided by the flags output specifier:

   1    forked but didn't exec
   4    used super-user privileges

PROCESS STATE CODES
   D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
   I    Idle kernel thread
   R    running or runnable (on run queue)
   S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
   T    stopped by job control signal
   t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
   W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
   X    dead (should never be seen)
   Z   a defunct ("zombie") process

For BSD formats and when the "stat" keyword is used, additional letters can be displayed:
   W   has no resident pages
   <   high-priority process
   N   low-priority task
   L   has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
   s   is a session leader
   l   is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES and PERSONALITY (posix,linux,bsd,sun)

********************

pushd
Syntax
      pushd [dir | +N | -N] [-n]

Key
   +N   Brings the Nth directory (counting from the left of the list printed by dirs,
        starting with zero) to the top of the list by rotating the stack.
       

   -N   Brings the Nth directory (counting from the right of the list printed by dirs,
        starting with zero) to the top of the list by rotating the stack. 

   -n   Suppresses the normal change of directory when adding directories to the 
        stack, so that only the stack is manipulated. 

   dir  Makes the current working directory be the top of the stack, and then executes 
        the equivalent of 'cd dir'. cds to dir.

********************

pv
Syntax
      pv [OPTION] [FILE]...

      pv [-h|-V] 

OptionsDisplay Switches
  If no display switches are specified, pv behaves as if -p, -t, -e, -r, and -b had been given
  (i.e. everything is switched on). Otherwise, only those display types that are explicitly switched on
  will be shown.

   -p, --progress
       Turn the progress bar on.
       If standard input is not a file and no size was given (with the -s modifier), the progress bar 
       cannot indicate how close to completion the transfer is, so it will just move left and right to 
       indicate thatdata is moving.

   -t, --timer
       Turn the timer on. This will display the total elapsed time that pv has been running for.

   -e, --eta
       Turn the ETA timer on. This will attempt to guess, based on previous transfer rates and the
       total data size, how long it will be before completion. This option will have no effect if the
       total data size cannot be determined.

   -r, --rate
       Turn the rate counter on. This will display the current rate of data transfer.

   -b, --bytes
       Turn the total byte counter on. This will display the total amount of data transferred so far.

   -n, --numeric
       Numeric output. Instead of giving a visual indication of progress, pv will give an integer
       percentage, one per line, on standard error, suitable for piping (via convoluted redirection)
       into dialog(1). Note that -f is not required if -n is being used.

   -q, --quiet
       No output. Useful if the -L option is being used on its own to just limit the transfer rate of a pipe.

Output Modifiers

   -W, --wait
       Wait until the first byte has been transferred before showing any progress information or calculating
       any ETAs. Useful if the program you are piping to or from requires extra information before it starts,
       eg piping data into gpg(1) or mcrypt(1) which require a passphrase before data can be processed.

   -s SIZE, --size SIZE
       Assume the total amount of data to be transferred is SIZE bytes when calculating percentages
       and ETAs. The same suffixes of "k", "m" etc can be used as with -L.

   -l, --line-mode
       Instead of counting bytes, count lines (newline characters). The progress bar will only move when
       a new line is found, and the value passed to the -s option will be interpreted as a line count.

   -i SEC, --interval SEC
       Wait SEC seconds between updates. The default is to update every second.
       Note that this can be a decimal such as 0.1.

   -w WIDTH, --width WIDTH
       Assume the terminal is WIDTH characters wide, instead of trying to work it out (or assuming 80 if
       it cannot be guessed).

   -H HEIGHT, --height HEIGHT
       Assume the terminal is HEIGHT rows high, instead of trying to work it out (or assuming 25 if it
       cannot be guessed).

   -N NAME, --name NAME
       Prefix the output information with NAME. Useful in conjunction with -c if you have a complicated
       pipeline and you want to be able to tell different parts of it apart.

   -f, --force
       Force output. Normally, pv will not output any visual display if standard error is not a terminal.
       This option forces it to do so.

   -c, --cursor
       Use cursor positioning escape sequences instead of just using carriage returns.
       This is useful in conjunction with -N (name) if you are using multiple pv invocations in a single,
       long, pipeline.

Data Transfer Modifiers

   -L RATE, --rate-limit RATE
       Limit the transfer to a maximum of RATE bytes per second. 
       A suffix of "k", "m", "g", or "t" can be added to denote kilobytes (*1024), megabytes, and so on.

   -B BYTES, --buffer-size BYTES
       Use a transfer buffer size of BYTES bytes. A suffix of "k", "m", "g", or "t" can be added to denote
       kilobytes (*1024), megabytes, and so on. The default buffer size is the block size of the input file's
       filesystem multiplied by 32 (512kb max), or 400kb if the block size cannot be determined.

   -R PID, --remote PID
       If PID is an instance of pv that is already running, -R PID will cause that instance to act as
       though it had been given this instance's command line instead. For example, if pv -L 123k is running
       with process ID 9876, then running pv -R 9876 -L 321k will cause it to start using a rate limit of
       321k instead of 123k. Note that some options cannot be changed while running, such as -c, -l, and -f.

General Options

   -h, --help
       Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

   -V, --version
       Print version information on standard output and exit successfully.

********************

pwd
Syntax
      pwd [-LP]

Options
      -P  : The pathname printed will not contain symbolic links.
      -L  : The pathname printed can contain symbolic links

********************

quota
Syntax
      quota [ -guv | q ]
      quota [ -uv | q ] user
      quota [ -gv | q ] group

Options
      -g     Print group quotas for the group of which the user is a member.

      -u     Print user quotas (this is the default)

      -v     Verbose, will display quotas on filesystems where no storage is allocated.

      -q     Print a more terse message, containing only information on filesystems
             where usage is over quota.

********************

quotacheck
Syntax
      quotacheck [ -gubcfinvdMmR ] [ -F quota-format ] -a | filesystem

Options
   -b, --backup
           Forces quotacheck to make backups of the quota file before writing the new data.

   -v, --verbose
           quotacheck reports its operation as it progresses. Normally it operates silently.
           If the option is specified twice, also the current directory is printed (note that printing can slow
           down the scan measurably).

   -d, --debug
           Enable debugging mode.
           It will result in a lot of information which can be used in debugging the program.
           The output is very verbose and the scan will be slow.

   -u, --user
           Only user quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems specified are to be checked.
           This is the default action.

   -g, --group
           Only group quotas listed in /etc/mtab or on the filesystems specified are to be checked.

   -c, --create-files
           Don't read existing quota files. Just perform a new scan and save it to disk.
           quotacheck also skips scanning of old quota files when they are not found.

   -f, --force
           Forces checking and writing of new quota files on filesystems with quotas enabled.
           This is not recommended as the created quota files may be out of sync.

   -M, --try-remount
           This flag forces checking of filesystem in read-write mode if a remount fails.
           Do this only when you are sure no process will write to a filesystem while scanning.

   -m, --no-remount
           Don't try to remount filesystem read-only. See comment with option -M.

   -i, --interactive
           Interactive mode. By default quotacheck exits when it finds an error.
           In interactive mode user is asked for input instead. See option -n.

   -n, --use-first-dquot
           If the quota files become corrupted, it is possible for duplicate entries for a single user
           or group ID to exist. Normally in this case, quotacheck exits or asks user for input.
           When this option is set, the first entry found is always used (this option works in interactive mode too).

   -F, --format=format-name
           Check and fix quota files of specified format (ie. don't perform format auto-detection).
           This is recommended as detection might not work well on corrupted quota files.
           Possible format names are: vfsold Original quota format with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs,
           vfsv0 Quota format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits,
           vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit quota limits and usage, rpc (quota over NFS),
           xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)

   -a, --all
           Check all mounted non-NFS filesystems in /etc/mtab

   -R, --exclude-root
           When used together with the -a option, all filesystems except for the root filesystem are checked for quotas.

rar
Syntax
      rar command [-switch_1 -switch_N] archive [files...]Commands:

   a      Add files to archive.

   c      Add archive comment. Comment length is limited to 62000 bytes.

   cf     Add files comment. File comments are displayed when  the  ’v’
          command is given. File comment length is limited to 32767 bytes.

   cw     Write archive comment to a specified file.

   d      Delete files from archive.

   e      Extract files to current directory. Does not create any
          subdirectories.

   f      Freshen files in archive. Updates those files changed since they
          were packed to the archive. This command will not add new to the
          archive.

   k      Lock  archive. Any command which intend to change the archive
          will be ignored.

   l[t]   List content of archive [technical]. Files are listed as the ’v’
          command with the exception of the file path. i.e.  the file name
          is displayed. Optional technical information displayed when  ’t’
          modifier is used.

   m[f]   Move to archive [files only]. Directories will not be removed if
          ’f’ modifier is used and/or ’-ed’ switch is applied.

   p      Print file to stdout.

   r      Repair archive. For further details look in rar.txt.

   rc     Reconstruct missing volumes using recovery volumes (.rev files).
          You need to specify any existing volume as the archive name, for
          example, ’rar rc backup.part03.rar’.

   rr[N]  Add data recovery record. Optionally, redundant information
          (recovery record) can be added to an archive.

   rv[N]  Create recovery volumes (.rev files), which can be later used to
          reconstruct missing files in a volume set. This command has sense
          only for multivolume archives. For further details look in rar.txt

   s[name|-]
          Convert archive to or from SFX. The archive is merged with SFX-module
          in the user’s home directory.

   t      Test archive files.

   u      Update  files  in archive. Adds files not already in the archive
          and updates files changed since they were packed to the archive.

   v[t]   Verbosely list archive [technical]

   x      Extract files with full path.


Switches:

   -ac    Clear Archive attribute after compression or extraction (Windows
          version only).

   -ag[format]
          Generate archive name using the current date and time. Appends
          the current date string to an  archive name when creating an archive.
          Useful for daily backups. For further details look in rar.txt.

   -ao    Add files with Archive attribute set (Windows version only).

   -ap    Set path inside archive. This path is merged to file names  when
          adding  files to an archive and removed from file names when
          extracting.

   -as    Synchronize archive contents. If this switch is used  when
          archiving, those archived files which are not present in the
          list of the currently added files, will be deleted from archive.
          It is convenient to use this switch in combination with -u
          (update) to synchronize contents of an archive and an  archiving
          directory.

   -av    Put authenticity verification (registered  versions  only).
          Details in register.txt.

   -av-   Disable AV checking or adding.

   -cfg-  Disable read configuration and environment.

   -cl    Convert file names to lower case.

   -cu    Convert file names to upper case.

   -c-    Disable comments show.

   -df    Delete files after archiving. This switch  in  combination  with
          the command "A" performs the same action as the command "M".

   -dh    Open shared files. Allows to process files opened by other
          applications for writing.

   -ds    Do not sort files while adding to a solid archive.

   -ed    Do not add empty directories.

   -ee    Do not process extended attributes. Only for OS/2 versions.

   -en    Do not add "end of archive" block.

          This switch cannot be used with volumes, because the end of
          archive  block contains information important for correct volume
          processing.

   -ep    Exclude paths from names.

   -ep1   Exclude base dir from names.

   -ep2   Expand paths to full. Store full file paths (except a drive
          letter and leading path separator) when archiving.

   -eAttr
          Specifies file exclude attributes mask.

   -f     Freshen files. Can be used with archive extraction or creation.

   -hppassword
          Encrypt both file data and headers. The password is case sensitive.
          If you omit the password on the command line, you will be prompted
          with message "Enter password".

   -idp   Disable percentage indicator.

   -ieml[.][addr]
          Send archive by email. Win32 version only.

   -ierr  Send all messages to stderr.

   -ilog  Log errors to file (registered versions only).

   -isnd  Enable sound.

   -k     Lock archive. Any command which intends to change the archive
          will be ignored.

   -kb    Keep broken extracted files.

   -m 0..5
          Set compression level (0-store...3-default...5-best). By default
          rar uses -m3 method (Normal compression).

   -mcpar
          Set advanced compression parameters. For further details look
          in rar.txt.

   -mdsize
          Set dictionary size in Kb (64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4097 or
          a,b,c,d,e,f,g)

   -ms[list]
          Specify file types to store.

   -o+    Overwrite existing files.

   -o-    Do not overwrite existing files.

   -ol    Save symbolic links as the link instead of the file.

   -os    Save NTFS streams. Win32 version only.

   -ow    Save file owner and group.

   -ppassword
          Encrypt files with the string password as password while
          archiving.   The password  is  case-sensitive. If you omit the
          password on the command line, you will be prompted with message
          "Enter password".

   -p-    Do not query password.

   -r     Recurse subdirectories.

   -r0    Similar to -r, but when used with the commands ’a’, ’u’, ’f’,

   -rip[:s]
          Set  priority and sleep time. Available only in RAR for Windows.

   -rr[N] Add data recovery record.

   -rv[N] Create recovery volumes.

   -s     Create solid archive.

   -sN    Create solid groups using file count. Similar to -s, but reset
          solid statistics after compressing N files.

   -se    Create solid groups using extension. Similar to -s, but reset
          solid statistics if file extension is changed.

   -sv    Create independent solid volumes. Similar to -s, but reset solid
          statistics as soon as possible when starting a new volume.

   -sv-   Create dependent solid volumes. Similar to -s, but reset of
          solid statistics is disabled.

   -s-    Disable solid archiving.

   -sfx[name]
          Create SFX archives. The archive is merged with SFX-module in
          the user’s home directory.

   -t     Test  files after archiving. This switch is especially useful in
          combination with the move command, so files will be deleted only
          if archive had been successfully tested.

   -tk    Keep  original  archive  time.  Prevents  rar from modifying the
          archive date when changing an archive.

   -tl    Set archive time to latest file. Forces rar to set the date of a
          changed archive to the date of the newest file in the archive.

   -u     Update files.

   -vsize[M|k|b|f]
          Create volumes with size=size*1000 [*1024, *1].

   -vd    Erase disk contents before creating  volume. All files and
          directories on the target disk will be erased when ’-vd’ is
          used. The switch applies only to removable media, the hard disk
          cannot be erased using this switch.

   -wpath
          Assign work directory.

   -xfile
          Exclude specified file.  Wildcards can be used and you may
          specify the switch ’-x’ several times.

   -x@list
          Exclude files in specified list file.

   -x@    Read file names to exclude from stdin.

   -y     Assume Yes on all queries.

   -zfile
          Read archive comment from file.

   -?     Display help on commands and switches. The same as when none  or
          an illegal command line option is entered.

   --     This switch tells RAR that there are no more switches in the
          command line. This can be useful if either archive or file name
          starts  from  a ’-’ character. Using the ’--’ switch will ensure
          that the name is not treated as switch.

         [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-r] [-s] [-t timeout] [-u fd]
            [name...]

Key
   -a aname             The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable aname, starting at 0.             aname is unset before any new values are assigned.  Other name arguments are ignored.   -d delim             The first character of delim is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.
   -e        If the standard input is coming from a terminal, readline is used to obtain the line.

   -i text   If readline is being used to read the line, text is placed into the editing buffer before editing begins. 
   -n nchars             read returns after reading nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input.

   -N nchars
             read returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line
             of input, unless EOF is encountered or read times out. Delimiter characters encountered in
             the input are not treated specially and do not cause read to return until nchars characters are read. 
   -p prompt             Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read             any input. The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
   -r        Do not treat a Backslash as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part             of the line. In particular, a backslash-newline pair can not be used as a line continuation.
             Without this option, any backslashes in the input will be discarded.
             You should almost always use the -r option with read.   -s        Silent mode. If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
   -t timeout             Cause read to time out and return failure if a complete line of input is not read             within timeout seconds. This option has no effect if read is not reading input from             the terminal or a pipe.
   -u fd     Read input from file descriptor fd.

********************

mapfile
Syntax
      mapfile [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
    readarray [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]

Key
   -d    The first character of delim is used to terminate each input line, rather than newline.
         If delim is the empty string, mapfile will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character. 

   -n    Copy at most count lines. If count is 0, all lines are copied.

   -O    Begin assigning to array at index origin. The default index is 0.

   -s    Discard the first count lines read.

   -t    Remove a trailing newline from each line read.

   -u    Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.

   -C    Evaluate callback each time quantum lines are read. The -c option specifies quantum.

   -c    Specify the number of lines read between each call to callback.

********************

readonly
Syntax
      readonly [-aApf] [name] ... 

Key
   -a   Treat each name as an array variable.

    The CVSIGNORE environment variable supplements any ignore patterns in .cvsignore files.
    See the --cvs-exclude option for more details.

RSYNC_RSH
    The RSYNC_RSH environment variable allows you to override the default shell used as
    the transport for rsync. This can be used instead of the -e option.

RSYNC_PROXY
    The RSYNC_PROXY environment variable allows you to redirect your rsync client to
    use a web proxy when connecting to a rsync daemon.
    You should set RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair.

RSYNC_PASSWORD
    Setting RSYNC_PASSWORD to the required password allows you to run authenticated
    rsync connections to a rsync daemon without user intervention.
    Note that this does not supply a password to a shell transport such as ssh.

USER or LOGNAME
    The USER or LOGNAME environment variables are used to determine the default
    username sent to a rsync server.

HOME
    The HOME environment variable is used to find the user's default .cvsignore file./etc/rsyncd.conf

sdiff
Syntax
      sdiff -o outfile [options] from-file to-file

Options

   Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument)
   can be combined into a single command line argument.

   -a
   --text Treat all files as text and compare them line-by- line,
          even if they do not appear to be text.

   -b
   --ignore-space-change
          Ignore changes in amount of white space.

   -B
   --ignore-blank-lines
          Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.

   -d
   --minimal
          Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.
          This makes sdiff slower (sometimes much slower).

   -H
   --speed-large-files
          Use heuristics to speed  handling of large files that have numerous scattered small changes.

   -i
   --ignore-case
          Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.

   -I regexp
          Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match regexp.

   --ignore-all-space
          Ignore white space when comparing lines.

   --ignore-matching-lines=regexp
          Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match regexp.

   -l
   --left-column
          Print only the left column of two common lines.

   -o file
   --output=file
          Put merged output into file. This option is required for merging.

   -s
   --suppress-common-lines
          Do not print common lines.

   -t
   --expand-tabs
          Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs
          in the input files.

   -v
   --version
          Output the version number of sdiff.

   -w columns
   --width=columns
          Use an output width of columns.  Note that for historical reasons,
          this option is -W in diff, -w in sdiff.

********************

sed
Syntax
      sed [options]...

Key
   -e SCRIPT
  --expression=SCRIPT
      Add the commands in SCRIPT to the set of commands to be run while
       processing the input.

   -f SCRIPT-FILE
   --file=SCRIPT-FILE
       Add the commands contained in the file SCRIPT-FILE to the set of
       commands to be run while processing the input.

   -n
   --quiet
   --silent
       By default, SED will print out the pattern space at then end of
       each cycle through the script.  These options disable this
       automatic printing, and SED will only produce output when
       explicitly told to via the 'p' command.

   -h
   --help
       Print a usage message and then exit.

   -V
   --version
       Print out version info and exit./REGEXP/
     This will select any line which matches the regular expression
     REGEXP.  If REGEXP itself includes any '/' characters, each must
     be escaped by a backslash ('\').

 /REGEXP/I
 \%REGEXP%I
     The 'I' modifier to regular-expression matching is a GNU extension
     which causes the REGEXP to be matched in a case-insensitive manner.d
     Delete the pattern space; immediately start next cycle.

 s/REGEXP/REPLACEMENT/FLAGS
     (The '/' characters can be uniformly replaced by any other single
     character within any given 's' command.)g       Apply the replacement to *all* matches to the REGEXP, not just the first.

    p       If the substitution was made, then print the new pattern space.

    NUMBER  Only replace the NUMBERth match of the REGEXP.

    w FILE-NAME
            If the substitution was made, then write out the result to the named file.

    I       Match REGEXP in a case-insensitive manner. This is a GNU extension.

      set [+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [+o option-name] [argument …]Options

Using + rather than - will cause the option to be turned off. 

   -a  Mark variables which are modified or created for export. -o allexport

   -b  Cause the status of terminated background jobs to be 
       reported immediately, rather than before printing the
       next primary prompt.  -o notify

   -B  The shell will perform brace expansion. 
       This option is on by default.  -o braceexpand

   -C  Prevent output redirection using '>', '>&',
       and '<>' from overwriting existing files.  -o noclobber

   -e  Exit immediately if a simple command exits with a non-zero status, unless
       the command that fails is part of an until or  while loop, part of an

       precede the command name. -o keyword
 
   -m  Job control is enabled.  -o monitor

   -n  Read commands but do not execute them; this can be used
       to check a script for syntax errors. 
       This option is ignored by interactive shells. -o noexec

   -o  If -o is supplied with no option-name, the values of the current options are printed.       If +o is supplied with no option-name, a series of set commands to recreate  the current
       option settings is displayed on the standard output.

   -o option-name
          Set the option corresponding to 'option-name'
          The 'option-names' are listed above and below (in bold):

                 allexport   Same as -a.
                 braceexpand Same as -B.
                 emacs       Use an emacs-style command line editing interface.  This is enabled by default
                             when the shell is interactive, unless the shell is started with --noediting
                 errtrace    Same as -E.

                 histexpand  Same as -H.
                 history     Enable command history, as described above under HISTORY.  This option  is  on
                              by default in interactive shells.
                 ignoreeof   The  effect is as if the shell command 'IGNOREEOF=10' had been executed
                 keyword     Same as -k.

                 pipefail    If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to 
                             exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully.
                             By default, pipelines only return a failure if the last command errors.

                             When used in combination with set -e, pipefail will make a script exit if any command
                             in a pipeline errors.

                 posix       Change the behavior of bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX

                 vi          Use a vi-style command line editing interface.
                 xtrace  Same as -x.

   -p  Turn on privileged mode.
       In this mode, the $BASH_ENV and $ENV files are not processed, shell functions are not
       inherited from the environment,  and the SHELLOPTS variable, if it appears in the environment,
       is ignored. If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the
       real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, these actions are taken and
       the effective user id is set to the real user id. 
       If the -p option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is not reset. 

       Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real user
       and group ids.   -o privileged 

   -P  If set, do not follow symbolic links when performing commands.
       The physical directory is used instead. -o physical

   -t  Exit after reading and executing one command.  -o onecmd

   -u  Treat unset variables as an error when performing 
       parameter expansion. An error message will be written 
       to the standard error, and a non-interactive shell will exit. -o nounset

   -v  Print shell input lines as they are read. -o verbose

   -x  Print a trace of simple commands and their arguments
       after they are expanded and before they are executed. -o xtrace

   -   Signal the end of options, cause all remaining arguments to be 
       assigned to the positional parameters. The '-x' and '-v' 
       options are turned off. If there are no arguments, the positional parameters 
       remain unchanged.MYDEPT=Sales echo $MYDEPTexport $MYDEPTIf '/usr/sys' is a symbolic link to '/usr/local/sys' then:

********************

shopt
Syntax
      shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]

Options
     -s   Enable (set) each optname

     -u   Disable (unset) each optname.

     -p   Display a list of all settable options, with an indication of 
          whether or not each is set. The output is displayed in a form 
          that can be reused as input. (-p is the default action)

     -q   Suppresses normal output; the return status indicates whether the optname
          is set or unset. If multiple optname arguments are given with '-q',
          the return status is zero if all optnames are enabled; non-zero otherwise. 

     -o   Restricts the values of optname to be those defined for the '-o' option to 
          the set builtin.optnames:

cdable_vars
    If this is set, an argument to the cd builtin command that 
    is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is 
    the directory to change to. 

cdspell
    If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd 
    command will be corrected. The errors checked for are transposed characters, 
    a missing character, and a character too many. If a correction is found, the 
    corrected path is printed, and the command proceeds. This option is only used 
    by interactive shells.

checkhash
    If this is set, Bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists 
    before trying to execute it. If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal 
    path search is performed. 

checkwinsize
    If set, Bash checks the window size after each command and, if necessary, 
    updates the values of LINES and COLUMNS. 

cmdhist
    If set, Bash attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the 
    same history entry. This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands. 

dotglob
    If set, Bash includes filenames beginning with a '.' in the results of filename 
    expansion. 

execfail
    If this is set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute 
    the file specified as an argument to the exec builtin command. 
    An interactive shell does not exit if exec fails. 

expand_aliases
    If set, aliases are expanded.
    This option is enabled by default for interactive shells. 

extglob
    If set, the extended pattern matching features described above are enabled. 

histappend
    If set, the history list is appended to the history file when the shell exits,
    rather than overwriting the history file. 
       shopt -s histappend

    To append every line to history individually set:
       PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'

    With these two settings, a new shell will get the history lines from all previous
    shells instead of the default 'last window closed'>history
    (the history file is named by the value of the HISTFILE variable)

histreedit
    If set, and Readline is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit 
    a failed history substitution. 

histverify
    If set, and Readline is being used, the results of history substitution 
    are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the resulting line 
    is loaded into the Readline editing buffer, allowing further modification. 

hostcomplete
    If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will attempt to perform hostname 
    completion when a word containing a '@' is being completed. 
    This option is enabled by default. 

huponexit
    If set, Bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits. 

interactive_comments
    Allow a word beginning with '#' to cause that word and all 
    remaining characters on that line to be ignored in an interactive shell.
    This option is enabled by default. 

lithist
    If enabled, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands 
    are saved to the history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon 
    separators where possible. 

mailwarn
    If set, and a file that Bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the
    last time it was checked, the message "The mail in mailfile  has been read" is
    displayed.

no_empty_cmd_completion
    If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will not attempt to search the 
    PATH for possible completions when completion is attempted on 
    an empty line. 

nocaseglob
    If set, Bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing 
    filename expansion. 

nullglob
    If set, Bash allows filename patterns which match no files to expand to 
    a null string, rather than themselves. 

progcomp
    If set, the programmable completion facilities are enabled.
    This option is enabled by default. 

promptvars
    If set, prompt strings undergo variable and parameter expansion after being 
    expanded. This option is enabled by default. 

restricted_shell
    The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode. The value 
    can not be changed. This is not reset when the startup files are executed, 
    allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted. 

shift_verbose
    If this is set, the shift builtin prints an error message when 
    the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters. 

sourcepath
    If set, the source builtin uses the value of PATH  to find the directory containing
    the file supplied as an argument. This option is enabled by default.

xpg_echo
    If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences 
    by default.

     -A      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This
             can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration
             file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             agent’s Unix-domain socket) can access the local agent through
             the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material
             from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys
             that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into
             the agent.

     -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     -b bind_address

             Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of
             the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one
             address.

     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
             stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The
             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the
             “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for
             protocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and
             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast
             networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis
             in the configuration files; see the Compression option.

     -c cipher_spec

             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The
             supported values are “3des”, “blowfish”, and “des”.  3des
             (triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three
             different keys.  It is believed to be secure.  blowfish is a fast
             block cipher; it appears very secure and is much faster than
             3des.  des is only supported in the ssh client for
             interoperability with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do
             not support the 3des cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due
             to cryptographic weaknesses.  The default is “3des”.

             For protocol version 2, cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of
             ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword
             for more information.

     -D [bind_address:]port

             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.
             This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
             side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently
             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act
             as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
             Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the
             configuration file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax:
             [bind_address/]port or by enclosing the address in square
             brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  By
             default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
             GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address can be
             used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
             that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     -e escape_char

             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
             The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a
             line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the
             connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and
             followed by itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the
             character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the session
             fully transparent.

     -F configfile
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a
             configuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide
             configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.  The
             default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

     -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
             This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or
             passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This
             implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
             remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

             If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to “yes”,
             then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port
             forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in
             the background.

     -g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

     -I smartcard_device

             Specify the device ssh should use to communicate with a smartcard
             used for storing the user’s private RSA key.  This option is only
             available if support for smartcard devices is compiled in
             (default is no support).

     -i identity_file
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for RSA or
             DSA authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for
             protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa for
             protocol version 2.  Identity files can also be specified on a
             per-host basis in the configuration file.  It is possible to have
             multiple -i options (and multiple identities specified in
             configuration files).

     -K      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)
             of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

     -k      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the
             server.

     -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport

             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be
             forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,
             optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port
             hostport from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be
             specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be
             specified with an alternative syntax:
             [bind_address/]port/host/hostport or by enclosing the address in
             square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged
             ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
             the GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may
             be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
             that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     -l login_name

             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also
             may be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.

     -M      Places the ssh client into "primary" mode for connection sharing.
             Multiple -M options places ssh into "primary" mode with
             confirmation required before replica connections are accepted.
             Refer to the description of ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for
             details.

     -m mac_spec

             Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of
             MAC (message authentication code) algorithms can be specified in
             order of preference.  See the MACs keyword for more information.

     -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just
             forwarding ports (protocol version 2 only).

     -n      Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from
             stdin).  This must be used when ssh is run in the background.  A
             common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote
             machine.  For example, ssh -n shadows.cs.hut.fi emacs & will
             start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will
             be automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.  The ssh

             program will be put in the background.  (This does not work if
             ssh needs to ask for a password or passphrase; see also the -f
             option.)

     -O ctl_cmd
             Control an active connection multiplexing primary process.  When
             the -O option is specified, the ctl_cmd argument is interpreted
             and passed to the primary process.  Valid commands are: "check"
             (check that the primary process is running) and "exit" (request
             the primary to exit).

     -o option

             Can be used to give options in the format used in the
             configuration file.  This is useful for specifying options for
             which there is no separate command-line flag.  For full details
             of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
             ssh_config(5).

     -p port
             Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be specified on
             a per-host basis in the configuration file.

     -q      Quiet mode.  Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be
             suppressed.  Only fatal errors are displayed.  If a second -q is
             given then even fatal errors are suppressed, except for those
             produced due solely to bad arguments.

     -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport

             Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to
             be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the remote
             side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the
             connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection
             is made to host port hostport from the local machine.

             Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.
             Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as root on
             the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing
             the address in square braces or using an alternative syntax:
             [bind_address/]host/port/hostport.

             By default, the listening socket on the server will be bound to
             the loopback interface only.  This can be overridden by
             specifying a bind_address.  An empty bind_address, or the address
             ‘*’, indicates that the remote socket should listen on all
             interfaces.  Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed
             if the server’s GatewayPorts option is enabled (see
             sshd_config(5)).

             If the port argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be dynamically
             allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.

     -S ctl_path

             Specifies the location of a control socket for connection
             sharing, or the string “none” to disable connection sharing.
             Refer to the description of ControlPath and ControlMaster in
             ssh_config(5) for details.

     -s      Used to request invocation of a subsystem on the remote
             system.  Subsystems are a feature of the SSH2 protocol which
             facilitate the use of SSH as a secure transport for other
             applications (eg. sftp(1)).  The subsystem is specified as the
             remote command.

     -T      Disable pseudo-tty allocation.

     -t      Force pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute
             arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be
             very useful, e.g. when implementing menu services.  Multiple -t

             options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.

     -V      Display the version number and exit.

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh to print debugging messages about its
             progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
             authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple -v options
             increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

     -w local_tun[:remote_tun]
             Requests tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4)
             devices between the client (local_tun) and the server
             (remote_tun).

             The devices can be specified by numerical ID or the keyword
             “any”, which uses the next available tunnel device.  If
             remote_tun is not specified, it defaults to “any”.  See also the
             Tunnel and TunnelDevice directives in ssh_config(5).  If the
             Tunnel directive is unset, it is set to the default tunnel mode,
             which is “point-to-point”.

     -X      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host
             basis in a configuration file.

             X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             user’s X authorization database) can access the local X11 display
             through the forwarded connection.  An attacker could then  perform
             activities such as keystroke monitoring.

             For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY
             extension restrictions by default.  Please refer to the ssh -Y

             option and the ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for
             more information.

     -x      Disables X11 forwarding.

     -Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not
             subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.

     -y      Send log information using the syslog(3) system module.  By
             default this information is sent to stderr.

     ssh can additionally obtain configuration data from a per-user
     configuration file and a system-wide configuration file.  The file format
     and configuration options are described in ssh_config(5).

     ssh exits with the exit status of the remote command or with 255 if an
     error occurred.~.      Disconnect.

     ~^Z     Background ssh.

     ~#      List forwarded connections.

     ~&      Background ssh at logout when waiting for forwarded connection /
             X11 sessions to terminate.

     ~?      Display a list of escape characters.

     ~B      Send a BREAK to the remote system (only useful for SSH protocol
             version 2 and if the peer supports it).

     ~C      Open command line.  Currently this allows the addition of port
             forwardings using the -L, -R and -D options (see above).  It also
             allows the cancellation of existing remote port-forwardings using
             -KR[bind_address:]port.  !command allows the user to execute a
             local command if the PermitLocalCommand option is enabled in
             ssh_config(5).  Basic help is available, using the -h option.

     ~R      Request rekeying of the connection (only useful for SSH protocol
             version 2 and if the peer supports it).$ ssh -f -L 1234:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10

           Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
           Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

     See the VerifyHostKeyDNS option in ssh_config(5) for more information.On the client:

           # ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true
           # ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252
           # route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2

     On the server:

           # ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252
           # route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1tunnel="1",command="sh /etc/netstart tun1" ssh-rsa ... jane
       tunnel="2",command="sh /etc/netstart tun2" ssh-rsa ... johnssh will normally set the following environment variables:

     DISPLAY               The DISPLAY variable indicates the location of the
                           X11 server.  It is automatically set by ssh to
                           point to a value of the form “hostname:n”, where
                           “hostname” indicates the host where the shell runs,
                           and ‘n’ is an integer ≥ 1.  ssh uses this special
                           value to forward X11 connections over the secure
                           channel.  The user should normally not set DISPLAY
                           explicitly, as that will render the X11 connection
                           insecure (and will require the user to manually
                           copy any required authorization cookies).

     HOME                  Set to the path of the user’s home directory.

     LOGNAME               Synonym for USER; set for compatibility with
                           systems that use this variable.

     MAIL                  Set to the path of the user’s mailbox.

     PATH                  Set to the default PATH, as specified when
                           compiling ssh.

     SSH_ASKPASS           If ssh needs a passphrase, it will read the
                           passphrase from the current terminal if it was run
                           from a terminal.  If ssh does not have a terminal
                           associated with it but DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS are
                           set, it will execute the program specified by
                           SSH_ASKPASS and open an X11 window to read the
                           passphrase.  This is particularly useful when
                           calling ssh from a .xsession or related script.
                           (Note that on some machines it can be necessary to
                           redirect the input from /dev/null to make this
                           work.)

     SSH_AUTH_SOCK         Identifies the path of a UNIX-domain socket used to
                           communicate with the agent.

     SSH_CONNECTION        Identifies the client and server ends of the
                           connection.  The variable contains four space-
                           separated values: client IP address, client port
                           number, server IP address, and server port number.

     SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND  This variable contains the original command line if
                           a forced command is executed.  It can be used to
                           extract the original arguments.

     SSH_TTY               This is set to the name of the tty (path to the
                           device) associated with the current shell or
                           command.  If the current session has no tty, this
                           variable is not set.

     TZ                    This variable is set to indicate the present time
                           zone if it was set when the daemon was started
                           (i.e. the daemon passes the value on to new
                           connections).

     USER                  Set to the name of the user logging in.

     Additionally, ssh reads ~/.ssh/environment, and adds lines of the format
     “VARNAME=value” to the environment if the file exists and users are
     allowed to change their environment.  For more information, see the
     PermitUserEnvironment option in sshd_config(5).~/.rhosts
             This file is used for host-based authentication (see above).  On
             some machines this file might need to be world-readable if the
             user’s home directory is on an NFS partition, because sshd(8)
             reads it as root.  Additionally, this file must be owned by the
             user, and must not have write permissions for anyone else.  The
             recommended permission for most machines is read/write for the
             user, and not accessible by others.

     ~/.shosts
             This file is used in exactly the same way as .rhosts, but allows
             host-based authentication without permitting login with
             rlogin/rsh.

     ~/.ssh/
             This directory is the default location for all user-specific
             configuration and authentication information.  There is no
             general requirement to keep the entire contents of this directory
             secret, but the recommended permissions are read/write/execute
             for the user, and not accessible by others.

     ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

             Lists the public keys (RSA/DSA) that can be used for logging in
             as this user.  The format of this file is described in the
             sshd(8) manual page.  This file is not highly sensitive, but the
             recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not
             accessible by others.

     ~/.ssh/config
             This is the per-user configuration file.  The file format and
             configuration options are described in ssh_config(5).  Because of
             the potential for abuse, this file must have strict permissions:
             read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.  It can be
             group-writable provided that the group in question contains only
             the user.

     ~/.ssh/environment
             Contains additional definitions for environment variables; see
             ENVIRONMENT, above.

     ~/.ssh/identity

     ~/.ssh/id_dsa
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa
             Contains the private key for authentication.  These files contain
             sensitive data and should be readable by the user but not
             accessible by others (read/write/execute).  ssh will  ignore a
             private key file if it is accessible by others.  It is possible
             to specify a passphrase when generating the key which will be used
             to encrypt the sensitive part of this file using 3DES.

     ~/.ssh/identity.pub
     ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

             Contains the public key for authentication.  These files are not
             sensitive and can (but need not) be readable by anyone.

     ~/.ssh/known_hosts
             Contains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has logged
             into that are not already in the systemwide list of known host
             keys.  See sshd(8) for further details of the format of this
             file.

     ~/.ssh/rc
             Commands in this file are executed by ssh when the user logs in,
             just before the user’s shell (or command) is started.  See the
             sshd(8) manual page for more information.

     /etc/hosts.equiv
             This file is for host-based authentication (see above).  It
             should only be writable by root.

     /etc/ssh/shosts.equiv
             This file is used in exactly the same way as hosts.equiv, but
             allows host-based authentication without permitting login with
             rlogin/rsh.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_config

             Systemwide configuration file.  The file format and configuration
             options are described in ssh_config(5).

     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
             These three files contain the private parts of the host keys and
             are used for host-based authentication.  If protocol version 1 is
             used, ssh must be setuid root, since the host key is readable
             only by root.  For protocol version 2, ssh uses ssh-keysign(8) to
             access the host keys, eliminating the requirement that ssh be
             setuid root when host-based authentication is used.  By default
             ssh is not setuid root.

     /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

             Systemwide list of known host keys.  This file should be prepared
             by the system administrator to contain the public host keys of
             all machines in the organization.  It should be world-readable.
             See sshd(8) for further details of the format of this file.

     /etc/ssh/sshrc
             Commands in this file are executed by ssh when the user logs in,
             just before the user’s shell (or command) is started.  See the
             sshd(8) manual page for more information.

strace
Syntax
      strace [ -dDffhiqrtttTvVxx ] [ -a column ] [ -e expr ]... [ -o file ] [ -p pid ]... 
         [ -s strsize ] [ -u username ] [ -E var=val ]... [ -E var ]... [ command [ arg... ] ]

      strace -c [ -D ] [ -e expr ]... [ -O overhead ] [ -S sortby ] [ command [ arg... ] ] 

Key
   -a column
       Align return values in a specific column (default column 40).

   -c  Count time, calls, and errors for each system call and report a summary on program exit.
       On Linux, this attempts to show system time (CPU time spent running in the kernel)
       independent of wall clock time. If -c is used with -f or -F (below), only aggregate
       totals for all traced processes are kept.

   -D  (Not available on SVR4 and FreeBSD.) Run tracer process as a detached grandchild,
       not as parent of the tracee. This reduces the visible effect of strace by keeping the
       tracee a direct child of the calling process.

   -d  Show some debugging output of strace itself on the standard error.

   -e expr
       A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace or how to trace them.
       The format of the expression is:
          [qualifier=][!]value1[,value2]...
       where qualifier is one of trace, abbrev, verbose, raw, signal, read, or write and value
       is a qualifier-dependent symbol or number. The default qualifier is trace. Using an
       exclamation mark negates the set of values. For example, -eopen means literally
          -e trace=open which in turn means trace only the open system call.
       By contrast, -etrace=!open means to trace every system call except open.
       In addition, the special values all and none have the obvious meanings.

       Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history expansion even inside quoted
       arguments. If so, you must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.

   -e trace=set
       Trace only the specified set of system calls.
       The -c option is useful for determining which system calls might be useful to trace.
       For example, trace=open,close,read,write means to only trace those four system calls.
       Be careful when making inferences about the user/kernel boundary if only a subset of
       system calls are being monitored. The default is trace=all.

   -e trace=file
       Trace all system calls which take a file name as an argument.
       You can think of this as an abbreviation for -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,... which is
       useful to seeing what files the process is referencing. Furthermore, using the
       abbreviation will ensure that you don't accidentally forget to include a call like lstat
       in the list. Betchya woulda forgot that one.

   -e trace=process
       Trace all system calls which involve process management. This is useful for watching
       the fork, wait, and exec steps of a process.

   -e trace=network
       Trace all the network related system calls.

   -e trace=signal
       Trace all signal related system calls.

   -e trace=ipc
       Trace all IPC related system calls.

   -e trace=desc
       Trace all file descriptor related system calls.

   -e abbrev=set
       Abbreviate the output from printing each member of large structures.
       The default is abbrev=all. The -v option has the effect of abbrev=none.

   -e verbose=set
       Dereference structures for the specified set of system calls. The default is verbose=all.

   -e raw=set
       Print raw, undecoded arguments for the specified set of system calls. This option has
       the effect of causing all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal. This is mostly
       useful if you don't trust the decoding or you need to know the actual numeric value
       of an argument.

   -e signal=set
       Trace only the specified subset of signals. The default is signal=all.
       For example, signal=!SIGIO (or signal=!io) causes SIGIO signals not to be traced.

   -e read=set
       Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data read from file descriptors
       listed in the specified set. For example, to see all input activity on file
       descriptors 3 and 5 use -e read=3,5. Note that this is independent from the normal
       tracing of the read(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=read.

   -e write=set
       Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data written to file descriptors
       listed in the specified set. For example, to see all output activity on file
       descriptors 3 and 5 use -e write=3,5. Note that this is independent from the normal
       tracing of the write(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=write. 

   -E var=val
       Run command with var=val in its list of environment variables.

   -E var
       Remove var from the inherited list of environment variables before passing it on to the command. 

   -f  Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of
       the fork(2) system call.  On non-Linux platforms the new process is attached to as
       soon as its pid is known (through the return value of fork(2) in the parent process).
       This means that such children can run uncontrolled for a while (especially in the case
       of a vfork(2)), until the parent is scheduled again to complete its (v)fork(2) call.
       On Linux the child is traced from its first instruction with no delay. If the parent
       process decides to wait(2) for a child that is currently being traced, it is suspended
       until an appropriate child process either terminates or incurs a signal that would cause
       it to terminate (as determined from the child's current signal disposition).

       On SunOS 4.x the tracing of vforks is accomplished with some dynamic linking trickery.

   -ff If the -o filename option is in effect, each processes trace is written to filename.pid
       where pid is the numeric process id of each process. This is incompatible with -c, since
       no per-process counts are kept.

   -F  This option is now obsolete and it has the same functionality as -f.

   -h  Print the help summary.

   -i  Print the instruction pointer at the time of the system call.

   -o filename
       Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr.
       Use filename.pid if -ff is used. If the argument begins with '|' or with '!' then the
       rest of the argument is treated as a command and all output is piped to it. This is
       convenient for piping the debugging output to a program without affecting the
       redirections of executed programs.

   -O overhead
       Set the overhead for tracing system calls to overhead microseconds. This is useful for
       overriding the default heuristic for guessing how much time is spent in mere measuring
       when timing system calls using the -c option. The accuracy of the heuristic can be
       gauged by timing a given program run without tracing (using time(1)) and comparing
       the accumulated system call time to the total produced using -c.

   -p pid
       Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing. The trace can be
       terminated at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal ( CTRL -C). strace will respond
       by detaching itself from the traced process(es) leaving it (them) to continue running.
       Multiple -p options can be used to attach to up to 32 processes in addition to command
       (which is optional if at least one -p option is given).

   -q  Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc. This happens automatically when output
       is redirected to a file and the command is run directly instead of attaching.

   -r  Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call. This records the time
       difference between the beginning of successive system calls.

   -s strsize
       Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32). Note that filenames are
       not considered strings and are always printed in full.

   -S sortby
       Sort the output of the histogram printed by the -c option by the specified criterion.
       Legal values are time, calls, name, and nothing (default time).

   -t  Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.

   -tt If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

   -ttt  If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds and the leading portion
         will be printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.

   -T  Show the time spent in system calls. This records the time difference between the
       beginning and the end of each system call.

   -u username
       Run command with the user ID , group ID , and supplementary groups of username.
       This option is only useful when running as root and enables the correct execution of
       setuid and/or setgid binaries. Unless this option is used setuid and setgid programs
       are executed without effective privileges.

   -v  Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios, etc. calls. These structures
       are very common in calls and so the default behavior displays a reasonable subset of
       structure members. Use this option to get all of the gory details.

   -V  Print the version number of strace.

   -x  Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string format.

   -xx Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.

********************

su
Syntax
      su [options]... [user [arg]...]

Options

   -c COMMAND
   --command=COMMAND
       Pass COMMAND, a single command line to run, to the shell with a -c option 
       instead of starting an interactive shell.

   -f
   --fast
       Pass the '-f' option to the shell.  This probably only makes sense if the shell run
       is 'csh' or 'tcsh', for which the '-f' option  prevents reading the startup file ('.cshrc').
       With Bourne-like shells, the '-f' option disables file name pattern expansion (globbing),
       which is not likely to be useful.

   -l
   --login
       Make the shell a login shell.  This means the following.  Unset all environment variables except
       'TERM', 'HOME', and 'SHELL' (which are set as described above), and 'USER' and 'LOGNAME' (which
       are set, even for the super-user, as described above), and set 'PATH' to a compiled-in default value.
       Change to USER's home directory.
       Prepend '-' to the shell's name, intended to make it read its login startup file(s).

   -m
   -p
   --preserve-environment
       Do not change the environment variables 'HOME', 'USER', 'LOGNAME', or 'SHELL'.
       Run the shell given in the environment variable 'SHELL' instead of the shell from
       USER's passwd entry, unless the user running 'su' is not the superuser
       and USER's shell is restricted.
       A "restricted shell" is one that is not listed in the file '/etc/shells', or in
       a compiled-in list if that file does not exist.
       Parts of what this option does can be overridden by '--login' and '--shell'.

   -s SHELL
   --shell=SHELL
       Run SHELL instead of the shell from USER's passwd entry, unless the user running
       'su' is not the superuser and USER's shell is restricted (see '-m' just above).

   --help

sudo, sudoedit - execute a command as another user
Syntax
      sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v 
 
      sudo [-HPSb] [-a auth_type] [-c class|-] [-p prompt]
        [-u username|#uid] {-e file [...] | -i | -s | command}

      sudoedit [-S] [-a auth_type] [-p prompt] [-u username|#uid] file [...] 

Options
   -H   Set the HOME environment variable to the homedir of the target user
        (root by default) as specified in passwd(5). By default, sudo does
        not modify HOME (see set_home and always_set_home in sudoers(5)).

   -K  (sure kill) like kill (-k) except that it removes the user's timestamp
        entirely. Like -k, this option does not require a password.

   -L   list defaults, list out the parameters that can be set in a Defaults
        line along with a short description for each. This option is useful
        in conjunction with grep(1).

   -P   Preserve group vector, causes sudo to preserve the invoking user's
        group vector unaltered. By default, sudo will initialize the group
        vector to the list of groups the target user is in. The real and
        effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user.

   -S   stdin, read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal.

   -V   Version, print the version number and exit.
        If the invoking user is already root the -V option will print out a
        list of the defaults sudo was compiled with as well as the machine's
        local network addresses.

   -a   Authentication type, use the specified authentication type when
        validating the user, as allowed by /etc/login.conf. The system
        administrator can specify a list of sudo-specific authentication
        methods by adding an "auth-sudo" entry in /etc/login.conf.
        This option is only available on systems that support BSD
        authentication where sudo has been configured with the
        --with-bsdauth option.

   -b   Background, run the given command in the background.
        Note that if you use the -b option you cannot use shell
        job control to manipulate the process.

   -c   Class, run the specified command with resources limited by
        the specified login class. The class argument can be either a
        class name as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a single '-' character.
        Specifying a class of -indicates that the command should be run
        restricted by the default login capabilities for the user the
        command is run as. If the class argument specifies an existing user
        class, the command must be run as root, or the sudo command must be
        run from a shell that is already root.
        This option is only available on systems with BSD login classes
        where sudo has been configured with the --with-logincap option.

   -e   Edit, instead of running a command, the user wishes to edit one
        or more files. In lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is
        used when consulting the sudoers file. If the user is authorized
        by sudoers the following steps are taken:
         1. Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the
            owner set to the invoking user.
         2. The editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables
            is run to edit the temporary files. If neither VISUAL nor EDITOR
            are set, the program listed in the editor sudoers variable is used.
         3. If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back
            to their original location and the temporary versions are removed. 
        If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
        Note that unlike most commands run by sudo, the editor is run with the
        invoking user's environment unmodified. If, for some reason, sudo is
        unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will receive
        a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary file. 

   -h   Help, print a usage message and exit.

   -i   Simulate initial login, run the shell specified in the passwd(5) entry
        of the user that the command is being run as. The command name argument
        given to the shell begins with a - to tell the shell to run as a login shell.
        sudo attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the shell.
        It also initializes the environment, leaving TERM unchanged, setting HOME ,
        SHELL , USER , LOGNAME , and PATH , and unsetting all other environment variables.
        Note that because the shell to use is determined before the sudoers file is
        parsed, a runas_default setting in sudoers will specify the user to run the
        shell as but will not affect which shell is actually run.

   -k   Kill, invalidates the user's timestamp by setting the time on it to the epoch.
        The next time sudo is run a password will be required.
        This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to
        revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file.

   -l   List, list out the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the user on the current host.

   -p   Prompt, allows you to override the default password prompt and use a custom one.
        The following percent ('%') escapes are supported:
         %u  expanded to the invoking user's login name
         %U  expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (defaults to root)
         %h  expanded to the local hostname without the domain name
         %H  expanded to the local hostname including the domain name
            (on if the machine's hostname is fully qualified or the fqdn sudoers option is set)
         %%  two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a single % character

  -s    Shell, runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is
        set or the shell as specified in passwd(5).

   -u   User, causes sudo to run the specified command as a user other than root.
        To specify a uid instead of a username, use #uid.
        Note that if the targetpw Defaults option is set (see sudoers(5)) it is
        not possible to run commands with a uid not listed in the password database.

   -v   Validate, sudo will update the user's timestamp, prompting for the user's password
        if necessary. This extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever
        the timeout is set to in sudoers) but does not run a command.

   --   Indicates that sudo should stop processing command line arguments.
        It is most useful in conjunction with the -s flag.

sum
Syntax
      sum [options]... [file]...

Options

 -r
     Use the default (BSD compatible) algorithm.  This option is

tar
Syntax
      tar [[-]function] [options] filenames...

      tar [[-]function] [options] -C directory-name...

   Command-line arguments that specify files to add to, extract from,
   or list from an archive can be given as shell pattern matching strings.

Functions:
   Exactly one of the following functions (shown in bold) must be specified:
   -A
   --catenate
   --concatenate  Append the contents of named file, which must itself be a
                  gnutar archive, to the end of the archive (erasing the old
                  end-of-archive block).  This has the effect of adding the
                  files contained in the named file to the first archive,
                  rather than adding the second archive as an element of the
                  first.  Note: This option requires a rewritable tarfile,
                  tapes.  (see notes below)
   -c
   --create     Create a new archive (or truncate an old one) and write the named files to it.

   -d
   --diff
   --compare    Find differences between files in the archive and
                corresponding files in the file system.

   --delete     Delete named files from the archive.
                (Does not work on quarter-inch tapes).
   -r
   --append     Append files to the end of an archive.
                (Does not work on quarter-inch tapes).
   -t
   --list       List the contents of an archive; if filename arguments are
                given, only those files are listed, otherwise the entire
                table of contents is listed.

   --test-label   Test the archive volume label and exit

   -u
   --update     Append the named files if the on-disk version has a modification date
                more recent than their copy in the archive(if any). 
                Does not work on quarter-inch tapes.
   -x
   --extract
   --get        Extract files from an archive.  The owner, modification time, and file
                permissions are restored, if possible. If no file arguments are given,
                extract all the files in the archive.
                If a filename argument matches the name of a directory on the tape, that directory
                and its contents are extracted (as well as all directories under that directory).
                If the archive contains multiple entries corresponding to the same file (see the --append command
                above), the last one extracted will overwrite all earlier versions.

   -C, --directory=DIR     change to directory DIR

   -f, --file=ARCHIVE     use archive file or device ARCHIVE

   -j, --bzip2     filter the archive through bzip2

   -J, --xz     filter the archive through xz

   -p, --preserve-permissions     extract information about file permissions (default for superuser)

   -v, --verbose     verbosely list files processed.

   -z, --gzip     filter the archive through gziptar: can't open /dev/rmt8 : No such device or address
   tar: can't open /dev/rsmt0 : I/O error--verbose' ('-v') shows details about the results of running 'tar'.--absolute-names
-P
     Normally when creating an archive, 'tar' strips an initial '/' from
     member names.  This option disables that behavior.

--after-date
     (See --newer.)

--atime-preserve
     Tells 'tar' to preserve the access time field in a file's inode
     when dumping it.

--backup=BACKUP-TYPE
     Rather than deleting files from the file system, 'tar' will back
     them up using simple or numbered backups, depending upon
     BACKUP-TYPE.

--block-number
-R
     With this option present, 'tar' prints error messages for read
     errors with the block number in the archive file.

--blocking-factor=BLOCKING
-b BLOCKING
     Sets the blocking factor 'tar' uses to BLOCKING x 512 bytes per
     record.

--bzip2
-I
     This option tells 'tar' to read or write archives through 'bzip2'.

--checkpoint
     This option directs 'tar' to print periodic checkpoint messages as
     it reads through the archive.  Its intended for when you want a
     visual indication that 'tar' is still running, but don't want to
     see --verbose' output.

--compress
--uncompress
-Z
     'tar' will use the 'compress' program when reading or writing the
     archive.  This allows you to directly act on archives while saving
     space.

--confirmation
     (See --interactive.)

--dereference
-h
     When creating a 'tar' archive, 'tar' will archive the file that a
     symbolic link points to, rather than archiving the symlink.

--directory=DIR
-C DIR
     When this option is specified, 'tar' will change its current
     directory to DIR before performing any operations.  When this
     option is used during archive creation, it is order sensitive.

--exclude=PATTERN
     When performing operations, 'tar' will skip files that match
     PATTERN.

--exclude-from=FILE
-X FILE
     Similar to --exclude, except 'tar' will use the list of patterns
     in the file FILE.

--file=ARCHIVE
-f ARCHIVE
     'tar' will use the file ARCHIVE as the 'tar' archive it performs
     operations on, rather than tar's compilation dependent default.

--files-from=FILE
-T FILE
     'tar' will use the contents of FILE as a list of archive members
     or files to operate on, in addition to those specified on the
     command-line.

--force-local
     Forces 'tar' to interpret the filename given to --file as a local
     file, even if it looks like a remote tape drive name.

--group=GROUP
     Files added to the 'tar' archive will have a group id of GROUP,
     rather than the group from the source file.  GROUP is first decoded
     as a group symbolic name, but if this interpretation fails, it has
     to be a decimal numeric group ID.

     Also see the comments for the --owner=USER option.

--gzip
--gunzip
--ungzip
-z
     This option tells 'tar' to read or write archives through 'gzip',
     allowing 'tar' to directly operate on several kinds of compressed
     archives transparently.

--help
     'tar' will print out a short message summarizing the operations and
     options to 'tar' and exit.

--ignore-failed-read
     Instructs 'tar' to exit successfully if it encounters an
     unreadable file. 

--ignore-umask
     (See --preserve-permissions'; *note Writing::..)

--ignore-zeros
-i
     With this option, 'tar' will ignore zeroed blocks in the archive,
     which normally signals EOF.  *Note Reading::.

--incremental
-G
     Used to inform 'tar' that it is working with an  old GNU-format
     incremental backup archive.  It is intended primarily for backwards
     compatibility only.

--info-script=SCRIPT-FILE
--new-volume-script=SCRIPT-FILE
-F SCRIPT-FILE
     When 'tar' is performing multi-tape backups, SCRIPT-FILE is run at
     the end of each tape.

--interactive
--confirmation
-w
     Specifies that 'tar' should ask the user for confirmation before
     performing potentially destructive options, such as overwriting
     files.

--keep-old-files
-k
     When extracting files from an archive, 'tar' will not overwrite
     existing files if this option is present.  *Note Writing::.

--label=NAME
-V NAME
     When creating an archive, instructs 'tar' to write NAME as a name
     record in the archive.  When extracting or listing archives, 'tar'
     will only operate on archives that have a label matching the
     pattern specified in NAME.

--listed-incremental=SNAPSHOT-FILE
-g SNAPSHOT-FILE
     During a --create' operation, specifies that the archive that
     'tar' creates is a new GNU-format incremental backup, using
     SNAPSHOT-FILE to determine which files to backup.  With other
     operations, informs 'tar' that the archive is in incremental
     format.

--mode=PERMISSIONS
     When adding files to an archive, 'tar' will use PERMISSIONS for
     the archive members, rather than the permissions from the files.
     The program 'chmod' and this 'tar' option share the same syntax
     for what PERMISSIONS might be.  *Note Permissions: (fileutils)File
     permissions.  This reference also has useful information for those
     not being overly familiar with the Unix permission system.

     Of course, PERMISSIONS might be plainly specified as an octal
     number.  However, by using generic symbolic modifications to mode
     bits, this allows more flexibility.  For example, the value 'a+rw'
     adds read and write permissions for everybody, while retaining
     executable bits on directories or on any other file already marked
     as executable.

--multi-volume
-M
     Informs 'tar' that it should create or otherwise operate on a
     multi-volume 'tar' archive.

--new-volume-script
     (see -info-script)

--newer=DATE
--after-date=DATE
-N
     When creating an archive, 'tar' will only add files that have
     changed since DATE.

--newer-mtime
     In conjunction with --newer', 'tar' will only add files whose
     contents have changed (as opposed to just --newer', which will
     also back up files for which any status information has changed).

--no-recursion
     With this option, 'tar' will not recurse into directories unless a
     directory is explicitly named as an argument to 'tar'.

--null
     When 'tar' is using the --files-from' option, this option
     instructs 'tar' to expect filenames terminated with 'NUL', so
     'tar' can correctly work with file names that contain newlines.

--numeric-owner
     This option will notify 'tar' that it should use numeric user and
     group IDs when creating a 'tar' file, rather than names.

--old-archive
     (See --portability.)

--one-file-system
-l
     Used when creating an archive.  Prevents 'tar' from recursing into
     directories that are on different file systems from the current
     directory.

--owner=USER
     Specifies that 'tar' should use USER as the owner of members when
     creating archives, instead of the user associated with the source
     file.  USER is first decoded as a user symbolic name, but if this
     interpretation fails, it has to be a decimal numeric user ID.

     There is no value indicating a missing number, and '0' usually
     means 'root'.  Some people like to force '0' as the value to offer
     in their distributions for the owner of files, because the 'root'
     user is anonymous anyway, so that might as well be the owner of
     anonymous archives.

--portability
--old-archive
-o
     Tells 'tar' to create an archive that is compatible with Unix V7
     'tar'.

--posix
     Instructs 'tar' to create a POSIX compliant 'tar' archive.

--preserve
     Synonymous with specifying both --preserve-permissions' and
     --same-order.

--preserve-order
     (See --same-order; *note Reading::..)

--preserve-permissions
--same-permissions
-p
     When 'tar' is extracting an archive, it normally subtracts the
     users' umask from the permissions specified in the archive and
     uses that number as the permissions to create the destination
     file.  Specifying this option instructs 'tar' that it should use
     the permissions directly from the archive.  *Note Writing::.

--read-full-records
-B
     Specifies that 'tar' should reblock its input, for reading from
     pipes on systems with buggy implementations.  *Note Reading::.

--record-size=SIZE
     Instructs 'tar' to use SIZE bytes per record when accessing the
     archive.

--recursive-unlink
     Similar to the --unlink-first option, removing existing
     directory hierarchies before extracting directories of the same
     name from the archive.  *Note Writing::.

--remove-files
     Directs 'tar' to remove the source file from the file system after
     appending it to an archive.

--rsh-command=CMD
     Notifies 'tar' that is should use CMD to communicate with remote
     devices.

--same-order
--preserve-order
-s
     This option is an optimization for 'tar' when running on machines
     with small amounts of memory.  It informs 'tar' that the list of
     file arguments has already been sorted to match the order of files
     in the archive.  *Note Reading::.

--same-owner
     When extracting an archive, 'tar' will attempt to preserve the
     owner specified in the 'tar' archive with this option present.

--same-permissions
     (See --preserve-permissions; *note Writing::..)

--show-omitted-dirs
     Instructs 'tar' to mention directories its skipping over when
     operating on a 'tar' archive.

--sparse
-S
     Invokes a GNU extension when adding files to an archive that
     handles sparse files efficiently.

--starting-file=NAME
-K NAME
     This option affects extraction only; 'tar' will skip extracting
     files in the archive until it finds one that matches NAME.  *Note Scarce::.

--suffix=SUFFIX
     Alters the suffix 'tar' uses when backing up files from the default '~'.

--tape-length=NUM
-L NUM
     Specifies the length of tapes that 'tar' is writing as being NUM x 1024 bytes long.

--to-stdout
-O
     During extraction, 'tar' will extract files to stdout rather than
     to the file system.  *Note Writing::.

--totals
     Displays the total number of bytes written after creating an
     archive.

--touch
-m
     Sets the modification time of extracted files to the extraction
     time, rather than the modification time stored in the archive.
     *Note Writing::.

--uncompress
     (See --compress.)

--ungzip
     (See --gzip.)

--unlink-first
-U
     Direct 'tar' to remove the corresponding file from the file system
     before extracting it from the archive.  *Note Writing::.

--use-compress-program=PROG
     Instruct 'tar' to access the archive through PROG, which is
     presumed to be a compression program of some sort.

--verbose
-v
     Be more verbose about the operation.
     This option can be specified multiple times (for some operations)
     to increase the amount of information displayed.

--verify
-W
     Verify that the archive was correctly written.

--version
     'tar' will print an informational message about what version it is
     and a copyright message, some credits, and then exit.

--volno-file=FILE
     Used in conjunction with --multi-volume'.  'tar' will keep track
     of which volume of a multi-volume archive its working in FILE.tar -czvf MyArchive Source_file

test
Syntax
      test expr
         [ expr ]
        [[ expr ]]! expr           True if expr is false.
  ( expr )         Returns the value of expr. This can be used to override the normal precedence of operators.

  expr1 && expr2   True if both expr1 and expr2 are true. 
  expr1 || expr2   True if either expr1 or expr2 is true.0 arguments  The expression is false.

  1 argument   The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.

  2 arguments  If the first argument is '!', the expression is true if and only if the second argument is
               null. If the first argument is one of the unary conditional operators, the expression is true
               if the unary test is true. If the first argument is not a valid unary operator, the expression is false.

  3 arguments  If the second argument is one of the binary conditional operators, the result of the expression
               is the result of the binary test using the first and third arguments as operands. If the first
               argument  is '!', the value is the negation of the two-argument test using the second and third
               arguments. If the first argument is exactly  '(' and the third argument is exactly ')', the result
               is the one-argument test of the second argument. Otherwise, the expression is false.
               The '-a' and '-o' operators are considered binary operators in this case.

  4 arguments  If the first argument is '!', the result is the negation of the three-argument expression composed

time
Syntax
      time [option...] command [arg...]

Options

   -o FILE
   --output=FILE
       Write the resource use statistics to FILE.

   -a
   --append
       *Append* the resource use information to the output file instead
       of overwriting it.

   -f FORMAT
   --format=FORMAT
       Use FORMAT as the format string, see below for formatting options.

   --help
       Summary of the command line options.

   -o FILE
   --output=FILE
       Write the resource use statistics to FILE.  By default, this
       *overwrites* the file, destroying the file's previous contents.

   -a
   --append
       *Append* the resource use information to the output file instead
       of overwriting it.  This option is only useful with the '-o' or '--output' option.

   -p
   --portability
       Use the POSIX format.

   -v
   --verbose
       Use the built-in verbose format, which displays each available
       piece of information on the program's resource use on its own
       line, with an English description of its meaning.

  -V
  --version
       Print the version number of 'time' and exit.

Options to 'time' must appear on the command line before COMMAND.
Anything on the command line after COMMAND is passed as arguments to
COMMAND.%Uuser %Ssystem %Eelapsed %PCPU (%Xtext+%Ddata %Mmax)k 
   %Iinputs+%Ooutputs (%Fmajor+%Rminor)pagefaults %Wswaps\t     a tab character

 \\     a literal backslash%E   Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in [hours:]minutes:seconds.

 %e   Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in seconds.

 %S   Total number of CPU-seconds used by the system on behalf of the
      process (in kernel mode), in seconds.

 %U   Total number of CPU-seconds that the process used directly (in user
      mode), in seconds.

 %P   Percentage of the CPU that this job got.  This is just user +
      system times divied by the total running time.

Memory Resources

 %M   Maximum resident set size of the process during its lifetime, in
      Kilobytes.

 %t   Average resident set size of the process, in Kilobytes.

 %K   Average total (data+stack+text) memory use of the process, in
      Kilobytes.

 %D   Average size of the process's unshared data area, in Kilobytes.

 %p   Average size of the process's unshared stack, in Kilobytes.

 %X   Average size of the process's shared text, in Kilobytes.

 %Z   System's page size, in bytes.  This is a per-system constant, but
       varies between systems.

I/O Resources

 %F   Number of major, or I/O-requiring, page faults that occurred while
      the process was running.  These are faults where the page has
      actually migrated out of primary memory.

 %R   Number of minor, or recoverable, page faults.  These are pages
      that are not valid (so they fault) but which have not yet been
      claimed by other virtual pages.  Thus the data in the page is
      still valid but the system tables must be updated.

 %W   Number of times the process was swapped out of main memory.

 %c   Number of times the process was context-switched involuntarily
      (because the time slice expired).

 %w   Number of times that the program was context-switched voluntarily,
      for instance while waiting for an I/O operation to complete.

 %I   Number of file system inputs by the process.

 %O   Number of file system outputs by the process.

 %r   Number of socket messages received by the process.

 %s   Number of socket messages sent by the process.

 %k   Number of signals delivered to the process.

Command Info

 %C   Name and command line arguments of the command being timed.

 %x   Exit status of the command.

timeout
Syntax
       timeout [option] duration command [arg]...

Key
   command
      The command to execute, this must not be a special built-in utility.
      Options must precede operands.

   --preserve-status
       Return the exit status of the managed command on timeout, rather than
       a specific exit status indicating a timeout.
       This is useful if the managed command supports running for an
       indeterminite amount of time.

   --foreground
       Don't create a separate background program group, so that the
       managed command can use the foreground TTY normally.
       This is needed to support timing out commands not started directly
       from an interactive shell, in two situations.

        1) command is interactive and needs to read from the terminal for example.
        2) The user wants to support sending signals directly
           to command from the terminal (like Ctrl-C for example) 

        Note in this mode of operation, any children of command will not be timed out.

   -k duration
   --kill-after=duration
       Ensure the monitored command is killed by also sending a ‘KILL’ signal, after
       the specified duration.
       Without this option, if the selected signal proves not to be fatal, timeout
       does not kill the command.

   -s signal
   --signal=signal
       Send this signal to command on timeout, rather than the default ‘TERM’ signal.
       signal can be a name like ‘HUP’ or a number. See Signal specifications. 

   duration is a floating point number followed by an optional unit:

       ‘s’ for seconds (the default)
       ‘m’ for minutes
       ‘h’ for hours
       ‘d’ for days

        A duration of 0 disables the associated timeout.
        Note that the actual timeout duration is dependent on system conditions,
        which should be especially considered when specifying sub-second timeouts.

   --help
        Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit successfully.

   --version
        Print the version number, then exit successfully.

   --   Delimit the option list. Later arguments, if any, are treated as operands
        even if they begin with -. For example, ‘sort -- -r’ reads from the file
        named -r. 

Exit status:

     124 if command times out
     125 if timeout itself fails
     126 if command is found but cannot be invoked
     127 if command cannot be found
     137 if command is sent the KILL(9) signal (128+9)
     The exit status of command otherwise

tmux
Syntax
      tmux [-28lquvV] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L socket-name] [-S socket-path] [command [flags]] 

Key
   -2'  Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

   -8'  Like -2, but indicates that the terminal supports 88 colours.

   -c shell-command
        Execute shell-command using the default shell.
        If necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option.
        This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.

   -f file
        Specify an alternative configuration file.
        By default, tmux loads the system configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present,
        then looks for a user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf.
        The configuration file is a set of tmux commands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.

        If a command in the configuration file fails, tmux will report an error and exit without executing further commands.

   -L socket-name
        tmux stores the server socket in a directory under /tmp (or TMPDIR if set); the default socket is named default.
        This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent tmux servers to be run.
        Unlike -S a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

        If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to recreate it.

   -l   Behave as a login shell.
        This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

   -q   Set the quiet server option to prevent the server sending various informational messages.

   -S socket-path
        Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.
        If -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is ignored.

   -u   tmux attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the first of the LC_ALL,
        LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables to be set for the string "UTF-8".
        This is not always correct: the -u flag explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.

        If the server is started from a client passed -u or where UTF-8 is detected, the utf8 and status-utf8
        options are enabled in the global window and session options respectively.

   -v   Request verbose logging.
        This option may be specified multiple times for increasing verbosity.
        Log messages will be saved into tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory,
        where PID is the PID of the server or client process.

   -V   Report the tmux version.

   command [flags]
       Specify one of a set of commands used to control tmux, as described in the following sections.
       If no commands are specified, the new-session command is assumed.C-b   Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
   C-o   Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
   C-z   Suspend the tmux client.

             tput sgr0    Reset all attributes
             tput cols    Display the number of columns
             tput lines   Display the number of lines

   parms   If the capability is a string that takes parameters,  the  arguments
           parms will be instantiated into the string.

   -S      Allow more than one capability per invocation of tput. The capabilities must
           be passed to  tput  from  the  standard  input instead  of  from the command
           line (see example).  Only one capname is allowed per line.

   -V      Reports the version of ncurses which was used in  this  program, and exits.

   init    If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user's
           terminal exists (see -Ttype, above), output the terminal's initialization strings
           and turn tabs expansion on or off according to the specification in the entry

   reset   Instead of putting out initialization strings, the terminal's reset strings
           will be output if present (rs1, rs2, rs3, rf).  If the reset strings are not
           present, but initialization strings are, the initialization  strings will be
           output. Otherwise, reset acts identically to init.

   longname
           If the terminfo database is present and an entry for the user's  terminal exists
           (see -Ttype above), then the long name of the terminal will be put out.
           The long name is the last name in the first line of the terminal's description in
           the  terminfo  database [see term(5)].

       If  tput  is invoked by a link named reset, this has the same effect as
       tput reset.  See tset for comparison, which has similar behavior.

traceroute
Syntax
      traceroute [options] host [packetsize]

Options:

   -I    Use ICMP ECHO for probes 
   -T    Use TCP SYN for probes 
   -U    Use UDP datagrams for probes (default). Only UDP is allowed for unprivileged users. 
   -d    Enable socket level debugging (when the Linux kernel supports it) 

   -F    Set the "Don't Fragment" bit. This tells intermediate routers not to fragment
         the packet when they find it's too big for a network hop's MTU. 

   -f first_ttl
         With what TTL to start. Default = 1 

   -g gateway
         Adds an IP source route gateway to the outgoing packet. Not useful, as
         most routers have disabled this for security reasons. 

   -i interface
         The interface through which traceroute should send packets.
         Default = select according to the routing table. 

   -m max_ttl
         The max no. of hops (max time-to-live value) traceroute will probe. Default=30 hops

   -N squeries
         The number of probe packets sent out simultaneously. Sending several probes
         concurrently can speed up traceroute considerably. Default = 16
         Note that some routers and hosts can use ICMP rate throttling. In such a situation
         specifying too large number can lead to loss of some responses. 

   -n    Show numerical addresses; do not look up hostnames.
         (Useful if DNS is not functioning properly.)

   -p port
         For UDP tracing: the destination port base traceroute will use
         (the destination port number will be incremented by each probe).
         For ICMP tracing: the initial icmp sequence value (incremented by each probe).
         For TCP tracing: the (constant) destination port to connect. 
   -t tos
         For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS) and Precedence value.
         Useful values are 16 (low delay) and 8 (high throughput).
         Note that in order to use some TOS precendence values, you have to be super user.
         For IPv6, set the Traffic Control value. 

   -w waittime
         Set the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe (default 5.0 sec). 

   -q nqueries
         Set the number of probe packets per hop. Default = 3 

   -r    Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.
         If the host is not on a directly-attached network, an error is returned.
         This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it. 

   -s source_addr
         Choose an alternative source address. You must select the address of one of the interfaces.
         Default = address of the outgoing interface. 

   -z sendwait
         Minimal time interval between probes (default 0). If the value is more than 10,
         then it specifies a number in milliseconds, else it is a number of seconds
        (float point values allowed too). Useful when some routers use rate-limit for icmp messages. 

   -A    Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and print results directly after
         the corresponding addresses 

   -V    Print the version and exit.

   --help  Print help info and exit. 

   -4, -6  Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 traceouting. By default, the program will try
           to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate protocol automatically.
           If resolving a host name returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, traceroute will use IPv4.

units
Syntax
      units options [FROM-UNIT [TO-UNIT]]

Options

 -c
 --check
     Check that all units and prefixes defined in the units file reduce
     to primitive units.  The program will print a list of all units
     that cannot be reduced.

 --check-verbose
     Like the '-check' option, this option prints a list of units that
     cannot be reduced.  But to help find unit  definitions that cause
     endless loops, it lists the units as they are checked.  If 'units'
     hangs, then the last unit to be printed has a bad definition.

 -o format
 --output-format format
     Use the specified format for numeric output.  Format is the same
     as that for the printf function in the ANSI C standard.  For
     example, if you want more precision you might use '-o %.15g'.

 -f filename
 --file filename
     Use filename as the units data file rather than the default units
     data file 'units.dat'.

 -h
 --help
     Print out a summary of the options for 'units'.

 -q
 --quiet
 --silent
     Suppress prompting of the user for units and the display of
     statistics about the number of units loaded.

 -s
 --strict
     Suppress conversion of units to their reciprocal units.

 -v
 --verbose
     Give slightly more verbose output when converting units.  When
     combined with the '-c' option this gives the same effect as
     '--check-verbose'.

 -V
 --version
     Print program version number, tell whether the readline library
     has been included, and give the location of the default units data

 -d DIRECTORY
 --directory=DIRECTORY
      Change directory to DIRECTORY before unpacking any files.

 -c
 --overwrite
 -f
 --force
      Passed as an option to the shar file.  Many shell archive scripts
      (including those produced by 'shar' 3.40 and newer) accepts a '-c'
      argument to indicate that existing files should be overwritten.

      The option '-f' is provided for a more unique interface.  Many
      programs (such as 'cp' and 'mv') use this option to trigger the
      very same action.

 -e
 --exit-0
      This option exists mainly for people who collect many shell
      archives into a single mail folder.  With this option, 'unshar'
      isolates each different shell archive from the others which have
      been put in the same file, unpacking each in turn, from the
      beginning of the file towards its end.  Its proper operation
      relies on the fact that many shar files are terminated by a
      'exit 0' at the beginning of a line.

      Option '-e' is internally equivalent to '-E "exit 0"'.

 -E STRING
 --split-at=STRING
      This option works like '-e', but it allows you to specify the
      string that separates archives if 'exit 0' isn't appropriate.
 
      For example, noticing that most '.signatures' have a '--' on a
      line right before them, one can sometimes use '--split-at=--' for
      splitting shell archives which lack the 'exit 0' line at end.  The
      signature will then be skipped altogether with the headers of the
      following message.

 --version
      Print the version number of the program on standard output, then
      immediately exits.

 --help
      Print a help summary on standard output, then immediately exits.

useradd
Syntax
      useradd [options] LOGIN

      useradd -D

      useradd -D [options]Options

   -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
       The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not specified.
       BASE_DIR is concatenated with the account name to define the home directory.
       If the -m option is not used, BASE_DIR must exist.
       If this option is not specified, useradd will use the base directory
       specified by the HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd, or /home by default.

   -c, --comment COMMENT
       Any text string. It is generally a short description of the login, and is
       currently used as the field for the user's full name. 

   -d, --home HOME_DIR
       The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the user's
       login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN name to BASE_DIR and
       use that as the login directory name. The directory HOME_DIR does not have
       to exist but will not be created if it is missing.

   -D, --defaults
       See below, the subsection "Changing the default values".

   -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
       The date on which the user account will be disabled.
       The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601).

       If not specified, useradd will use the default expiry date specified by
       the EXPIRE variable in /etc/default/useradd, or an empty string
       (no expiry) by default.

   -f, --inactive INACTIVE
       The number of days after a password expires until the account is
       permanently disabled. A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the
       password has expired, and a value of -1 disables the feature.

       If not specified, useradd will use the default inactivity period
       specified by the INACTIVE variable in /etc/default/useradd,
       or -1 by default.

   -g, --gid GROUP
       The group name or number of the user's initial login group.
       The group name must exist.
       A group number must refer to an already existing group.

       If not specified, the bahavior of useradd will depend on the
       USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs. If this variable is
       set to yes (or -U/--user-group is specified on the command line),
       a group will be created for the user, with the same name as her
       loginname.
       If the variable is set to no (or -N/--no-user-group is specified
       on the command line), useradd will set the primary group of the
       new user to the value specified by the GROUP variable
       in /etc/default/useradd, or 100 by default.

   -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
       A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
       Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no
       intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same
       restrictions as the group given with the -g option.
       The default is for the user to belong only to the initial group.

   -h, --help
       Display help message and exit.

   -k, --skel SKEL_DIR
       The skeleton directory, which contains files and directories to
       be copied in the user's home directory, when the home directory is created by useradd.

       This option is only valid if the -m (or --create-home) option is specified.

       If this option is not set, the skeleton directory is defined
       by the SKEL variable in /etc/default/useradd or, by default, /etc/skel.

   -K, --key KEY=VALUE
       Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults
       (UID_MIN, UID_MAX, UMASK, PASS_MAX_DAYS and others).

       Example: -K PASS_MAX_DAYS=-1 can be used when creating system account
       to turn off password ageing, even though system account has no password
       at all. Multiple -K options can be specified, e.g.: -K UID_MIN=100 -K UID_MAX=499

       Note: -K UID_MIN=10,UID_MAX=499 doesn't work yet.

   -l, --no-log-init
       Do not add the user to the lastlog and faillog databases.

       By default, the user's entries in the lastlog and faillog databases
       are resetted to avoid reusing the entry from a previously deleted user.

   -m, --create-home
       Create the user's home directory if it does not exist.
       The files and directories contained in the skeleton directory
       (which can be defined with the -k option) will be copied to the home directory.

       By default, no home directories are created.

   -M
       Do not create the user's home directory, even if the system wide
       setting from /etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME) is set to yes.

   -N, --no-user-group
       Do not create a group with the same name as the user, but add
       the user to the group specified by the -g option or by the
       GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd.

       The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified)
       is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs.

   -o, --non-unique
       Allow the creation of a user account with a duplicate (non-unique) UID.

       This option is only valid in combination with the -o option.

   -p, --password PASSWORD
       The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).
       The default is to disable the password.

       Note: This option is not recommended because the password
       (or encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes.

       You should make sure the password respects the system's password policy.

   -r, --system
       Create a system account.

       System users will be created with no aging information in /etc/shadow,
       and their numeric identifiers are choosen in the
       SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in /etc/login.defs, instead of
       UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for the creation of groups).

       Note that useradd will not create a home directory for such an user,
       regardless of the default setting in /etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME).
       You have to specify the -m options if you want a home directory for
       a system account to be created.

   -s, --shell SHELL
       The name of the user's login shell.
       The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to
       select the default login shell specified by the SHELL variable in
       /etc/default/useradd, or an empty string by default.

   -u, --uid UID
       The numerical value of the user's ID.
       This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.
       The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the smallest
       ID value greater than 999 and greater than every other user.
       Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system accounts.

   -U, --user-group
       Create a group with the same name as the user, and add the user to this group.
   
       The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified)
       is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs.

   -Z, --selinux-user SEUSER
       The SELinux user for the user's login.
       The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to
       select the default SELinux user. 

   Changing the default values

   When invoked with only the -D option, useradd will display the current
   default values. When invoked with -D plus other options, useradd will
   update the default values for the specified options.

   Valid default-changing options are:

   -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
       The path prefix for a new user's home directory.
       The user's name will be affixed to the end of BASE_DIR to form
       the new user's home directory name, if the -d option is not used
       when creating a new account.

       This option sets the HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd.

   -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
       The date on which the user account is disabled.

       This option sets the EXPIRE variable in /etc/default/useradd.

   -f, --inactive INACTIVE
       The number of days after a password has expired before the
       account will be disabled.

       This option sets the INACTIVE variable in /etc/default/useradd.

   -g, --gid GROUP
       The group name or ID for a new user's initial group
       (when the -N/--no-user-group is used or when the USERGROUPS_ENAB
       variable is set to no in /etc/login.defs.
       The named group must exist, and a numerical group ID must have an existing entry.

       This option sets the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd.

   v-s, --shell SHELL
       The name of a new user's login shell.

       This option sets the SHELL variable in /etc/default/useradd./etc/passwd
    User account information. 
/etc/shadow
    Secure user account information. 
/etc/group
    Group account information. 
/etc/gshadow

9    username already in use 
10   can't update group file 
12   can't create home directory 
13   can't create mail spool

********************

userdel
Syntax
      userdel [options] LOGINOptions
   -f, --force
      This option forces the removal of the user account, even if
      the user is still logged in. It also forces userdel to remove
      the user's home directory and mail spool, even if another user
      uses the same home directory or if the mail spool is not owned
      by the specified user.
      If USERGROUPS_ENAB is defined to yes in /etc/login.defs and if
      a group exists with the same name as the deleted user, then this
      group will be removed, even if it is still the primary group of
      another user.

      Note: This option is dangerous and can leave your system in
      an inconsistent state. 

   -h, --help
      Display help message and exit. 

   -r, --remove
      Files in the user's home directory will be removed along with
      the home directory itself and the user's mail spool.
      Files located in other file systems will have to be searched
      for and deleted manually.

      The mail spool is defined by the MAIL_DIR variable in the login.defs file.0  Success 
 1  Can't update password file 
 2  Invalid command syntax 
 6  Specified user doesn't exist 
 8  User currently logged in 
 10 Can't update group file 
 12 Can't remove home directory

                date is in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
                Two-digit year fields are also accepted.
                The value is stored as the number of days since January 1, 1970.
                This option requires the use of shadow passwords.

  -f days       Permanently disable account this many days after the
                password has expired. A value of -1 disables this feature.
                This option requires the use of shadow passwords.

  -g group      Initial group name or ID number.
                If a different default group has not been specified using the -D option,

  -G groups     Supplementary groups given by name or number in a comma-separated
                list with no whitespace. The user will be removed from any groups to
                which they currently belong that are not included in groups.

  -l name       Login name. This cannot be changed while the user is logged in.

  -o            Override. Accept a nonunique uid with the -u option. (Probably a bad idea.)

  -s shell      Login shell.

  -u uid        Numerical user ID. The value must be unique unless the -o option is used.
                The default value is the smallest ID value greater than 99 and greater
                than every other uid.

********************

which
Syntax
      which [options] [--] program_name [...]

Options
    --all, -a
        Print all matching executables in PATH, not just the first.

    --read-alias, -i
        Read aliases from stdin, reporting matching ones on stdout.
        This is useful in combination with using an alias for which itself.
        For example  alias which='alias | which -i'.

    --skip-alias
        Ignore option --read-alias, if any.  This is useful to explicity search
        for normal binaries, while using the --read-alias option in an alias for which.

    --skip-dot
        Skip directories in PATH that start with a dot.

    --skip-tilde
        Skip directories in PATH that start with a tilde and
        executables which reside in the HOME directory.

    --show-dot
        If a directory in PATH starts with a dot and a matching 
        executable was found for that path, then print
        "./program_name" rather than the full path.

    --show-tilde
        Output a tilde when a directory matches the HOME directory.
        This option is ignored when which is invoked as root.

    --tty-only
        Stop processing options on the right if not on tty.

    --version, -v, -V
        Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.

    --help
        Print usage information on standard output then exit successfully.

RETURN VALUE
       Which returns the number of failed arguments, or -1 when
       no programname was given.

EXAMPLE
       A useful way to use this utility is by adding an alias for
       which like the following:

       alias which='which --tty-only --show-tilde --show-dot'

       This will print the readable ~/ and ./ when starting which
       from  your prompt, while still printing the full path when
       used from a script:

              > which q2
              ~/bin/q2
              > echo 'which q2'
              /home/carlo/bin/q2

       Aliases are also supported, through the use  of  an  alias
       for  which  itself.   An  example  alias for which that is
       using this feature is as follows:

       alias which='alias | which --tty-only --read-alias --show-tilde --show-dot'

       This will print the output of alias for  each  alias  that
       matches  one  of  the given arguments.  For example, using
       this alias on itself in a tcsh:

              $ alias which alias \| /usr/bin/which -i !\*
              $ which which
              which   (alias | ./which -i !*)
                      /usr/bin/which

BUGS
       The HOME directory is determined by looking for the HOME environment variable,
       which exits when this variable doesn't exist.
       Which will consider two equivalent  directories to be different when one of
       them contains a path with a symbolic link.

xargs
Syntax
      xargs [options] [command]

Options
   --arg-file=file
   -a file
            Read items from file instead of standard input.
            If you use this option, stdin remains unchanged when commands are run.
            Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null. 

   -0
   --null
            Expect filenames to be terminated by NULL instead of whitespace, and the quotes and
            backslash are not special (every character is taken literally).
            Disables the end of file string, which is treated like any other argument.
            Useful when input items might contain white space, quote marks, or backslashes.
            The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for this mode. 

   --delimiter=delim
   -d delim
            Input items are terminated by the specified character.
            Quotes and backslash are not special; every character in the input is taken literally. 
            Disables the end-of-file string, which is treated like any other argument.
            This can be used when the input consists of just newline-separated items,
            although it is almost always better to design your program to use --null where this
            is possible. The specified delimiter can be a single character, a C-style character
            escape such as \n, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.
            Octal and hexadecimal escape codes are understood as for the printf command.
            Multibyte characters are not supported. 

   -E eof-str
            Set the end of file string to eof-str. If the end of file string occurs as a line of input,
            the rest of the input is ignored. If neither -E nor -e is used, no end of file string is used.
   --eof[=eof-str]
    -e[eof-str]
            This option is a synonym for the -E option. Use -E instead, because it is POSIX compliant
            while this option is not. If eof-str is omitted, there is no end of file string. 
            If neither -E nor -e is used, no end of file string is used. 

   --help
            Print a summary of the options to xargs and then exit.
   -I replace-str
            Replace occurrences of replace-str in the initial-arguments with names read from standard
            input. Also, unquoted blanks do not terminate input items; instead the separator is the
            newline character. Implies -x and -L 1.

   --replace[=replace-str]
    -i[replace-str]     This option is a synonym for -I replace-str if replace-str is specified, and
                        for -I{} otherwise. This option is deprecated; use -I instead.

   -L max-lines
            Use at most max-lines nonblank input lines per command line.
            Trailing blanks cause an input line to be logically continued on the next input line.
            Implies -x.

   --max-lines[=max-lines]
    -l[max-lines]
            Synonym for the -L option. Unlike -L, the max-lines argument is optional.
            If max-lines is not specified, it defaults to one. The -l option is deprecated since the
            POSIX standard specifies -L instead.

   --max-args=max-args
    -n max-args
            Use at most max-args arguments per command line. Fewer than max-args arguments will be used
            if the size (see the -s option) is exceeded, unless the -x option is given, in which case
            xargs will exit. 

   -p
   --interactive
            Prompt for confirmation before running each command line.
            Only run the command line if the response starts with 'y' or 'Y'. Implies -t.

   -P max
   --max-procs=max
            Allow no more than max processes to run at once.
            The default is 1. A maximum of 0 allows as many as possible to run at once.
            Use the -n option with -P; otherwise chances are that only one exec will be done. 

   -r
   --no-run-if-empty
            Do not run command if standard input contains only blanks.

   -s max
   --max-chars=max
            Allow no more than max characters per command line, including the command and
            initial-arguments and the terminating nulls at the ends of the argument strings.
            The largest allowed value is system-dependent, and is calculated as the argument length
            limit for exec, less the size of your environment, less 2048 bytes of headroom.
            If this value is more than 128KiB, 128Kib is used as the default value; otherwise, the
            default value is the maximum. 1KiB is 1024 bytes. 

   -t
   --verbose
            Print the command line (on standard error output) before executing it.

   -x
   --exit
            If the maximum size (as specified by -s) is exceeded, exit.

   --version
            Print the version number of xargs and then exit.$ find ./music -name "*.mp3" -print0 | xargs -0 ls$ find ./work -print | xargs grep "profit"$ find ./work -mmin -30 | xargs -0 rm$ find ./work -print0 | xargs -0 rm$ echo $* | xargs -n2 diff$ cat file | xargs -n1$ ls olddir | xargs -i -t mv olddir/ newdir/

Key

Operation mode:

       -z, --compress
              Force compression

       -d, --decompress
              Force decompression

       -t, --test
              Test compressed file integrity

       -l, --list
              List information about files

Operation modifiers:

       -k, --keep
              Keep (don’t delete) input files

       -f, --force
              Force overwrite of output file and (de)compress links

       -c, --stdout
              Write to standard output and don’t delete input files

       -S, --suffix=.SUF
              Use the suffix ‘.SUF’ on compressed files

       --files=[FILE]
              Read  filenames  to  process  from  FILE;  if  FILE  is omitted,
              filenames are read from the standard input;  filenames  must  be
              terminated with the newline character

       --files0=[FILE] like --files but use the null character as terminator

              Basic file format and compression options:

       -F, --format=FMT
              File  format  to  encode  or  decode; possible values are ‘auto’
              (default), ‘xz’, ‘lzma’, and ‘raw’

       -C, --check=CHECK
              integrity check type: ‘crc32’, ‘crc64’ (default), or ‘sha256’

       -0 .. -9
              Compression preset; 0-2 fast compression, 3-5 good  compression,
              6-9 excellent compression; default is 6

       -e, --extreme
              Use  more  CPU  time when encoding to increase compression ratio
              without increasing memory usage of the decoder

       -M, --memory=NUM
              Use roughly NUM bytes of memory  at  maximum;  0  indicates  the
              default  setting,  which  depends  on the operation mode and the
              amount of physical memory (RAM)

              Custom filter  chain  for  compression  (alternative  for  using
              presets):

       --lzma1=[OPTS]

       --lzma2=[OPTS]

              LZMA1 or LZMA2; OPTS is a comma-separated list of zero or
              more   of   the   following  options  (valid  values;  default):

              0=automatic (default)

       --x86  x86 filter (sometimes called BCJ filter)

       --powerpc
              PowerPC (big endian) filter

       --ia64 IA64 (Itanium) filter

       -H, --long-help
              display this long help

       -V, --version
              display the version number

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, reads standard input.

Exit Status

    1 - All is good.
    2 - An error occurred.
    3 - Something worth a warning occurred, but no actual errors occurred.

   Notices (not warnings or errors) printed on standard error don't affect the exit status.

zip
Syntax:

      zip [-aABcdDeEfFghjklLmoqrRSTuvVwXyz!@$] [--longoption ...]
         [-b path] [-n suffixes] [-t date] [-tt date]
            [zipfile [file ...]] [-xi list] 

Options
      -a
       --ascii
              [Systems using EBCDIC] Translate file to ASCII format.

       -A
       --adjust-sfx
              Adjust self-extracting executable  archive.   A  self-extracting
              executable  archive  is created by prepending the SFX stub to an
              existing archive. The -A option tells zip to  adjust  the  entry
              offsets  stored in the archive to take into account this "preamble"
              data.

       Note: self-extracting archives for the Amiga are a  special  case.   At
       present, only the Amiga port of zip is capable of adjusting or updating
       these without corrupting them. -J can be used to remove the SFX stub if
       other updates need to be made.

       -AC
       --archive-clear
              [WIN32]   Once  archive  is  created  (and tested if -T is used,
              which is recommended), clear the  archive  bits  of  files  processed.
              WARNING:  Once  the bits are cleared they are cleared.
              You might want to use the -sf show files option to store the list
              of  files  processed  in  case  the  archive  operation  must be
              repeated.  Also consider using the -MM must  match  option. Be
              sure to check out -DF as a possibly better way to do incremental
              backups.

       -AS
       --archive-set
              [WIN32]  Only include files  that  have  the  archive  bit  set.
              Directories  are  not stored when -AS is used, though by default
              the paths of entries, including directories, are stored as usual
              and can be used by most unzips to recreate directories.

              The  archive  bit  is set by the operating system when a file is
              modified and, if used with -AC, -AS can provide  an  incremental
              backup  capability.   However, other applications can modify the
              archive bit and it may not be  a  reliable  indicator  of  which
              files  have  changed since the last archive operation.  Alternative
              ways to create incremental backups are using -t to use file
              dates,  though  this won't catch old files copied to directories
              being archived, and -DF to create a differential archive.

       -B
       --binary
              [VM/CMS and MVS] force file to be read binary (default is text).

       -Bn    [TANDEM] set Edit/Enscribe formatting options with n defined as
              bit  0: Don't add delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
              bit  1: Use LF rather than CR/LF as delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
              bit  2: Space fill record to maximum record length (Enscribe)
              bit  3: Trim trailing space (Enscribe)
              bit  8: Force 30K (Expand) large read for unstructured files

       -b path
       --temp-path path
              Use  the specified path for the temporary zip archive.
              For example:

                     zip -b /tmp stuff *

              will put the temporary zip archive in the directory /tmp,  copying
              over stuff.zip to the  current directory when done. This option is
              useful when updating an existing archive and the file system
              containing this old archive does not have enough space to
              hold both old and new archives at the same time.  It can also be
              useful  when  streaming in some cases to avoid the need for data
              descriptors.  Note that using this option can require zip to take
              additional time to copy the archive file when done to the
              destination file system.

       -c
       --entry-comments
              Add one-line comments for each file.  File  operations  (adding,
              updating)  are  done  first, and the user is then prompted for a
              one-line comment for each file.  Enter the comment  followed  by
              return, or just return for no comment.

       -C
       --preserve-case
              [VMS]   Preserve  case  all  on VMS.  Negating this option (-C-)
              downcases.

       -C2
       --preserve-case-2
              [VMS]  Preserve case ODS2 on VMS.  Negating this  option  (-C2-)
              downcases.

       -C5
       --preserve-case-5
              [VMS]   Preserve  case ODS5 on VMS.  Negating this option (-C5-)
              downcases.

       -d
       --delete
              Remove (delete) entries from a zip archive.  For example:

                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\* \*.o

              will remove the entry foo/tom/junk, all of the files that  start
              with  foo/harry/,  and all of the files that end with .o (in any
              path).  Note that shell pathname expansion  has  been  inhibited
              with  backslashes,  so  that zip can see the asterisks, enabling
              zip to match on the contents of the zip archive instead  of  the
              contents  of  the  current  directory.  (The backslashes are not
              used on MSDOS-based platforms.)  Can also use quotes  to  escape
              the asterisks as in

                     zip -d foo foo/tom/junk "foo/harry/*" "*.o"

              Not  escaping  the asterisks on a system where the shell expands
              wildcards could result in the asterisks  being  converted  to  a
              list  of  files  in  the current directory and that list used to
              delete entries from the archive.

              Under MSDOS, -d is case sensitive when it matches names  in  the
              zip  archive.  This requires that file names be entered in upper
              case if they were zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.  (We  considered
              making this case insensitive on systems where paths were
              case insensitive, but it is possible the  archive  came  from  a
              system where case does matter and the archive could include both
              Bar and bar as separate files in the archive.)  But see the new
              option -ic to ignore case in the archive.

       -db
       --display-bytes
              Display  running  byte  counts  showing the bytes zipped and the
              bytes to go.

       -dc
       --display-counts
              Display running count of entries zipped and entries to go.

       -dd
       --display-dots
              Display dots while each entry is zipped (except  on  ports  that
              have  their  own progress indicator).  See -ds below for setting
              dot size.  The default is a dot every 10 MB of input  file  pro-
              cessed.   The -v option also displays dots (previously at a much
              higher rate than this but now -v also defaults  to  10  MB)  and
              this rate is also controlled by -ds.

       -df
       --datafork
              [MacOS] Include only data-fork of files zipped into the archive.
              Good  for  exporting   files   to   foreign   operating-systems.
              Resource-forks will be ignored at all.

       -dg
       --display-globaldots
              Display  progress dots for the archive instead of for each file.
              The command

                         zip -qdgds 10m

              will turn off most output except dots every 10 MB.

       -ds size
       --dot-size size
              Set amount of input file processed for each dot displayed.   See
              -dd to enable displaying dots.  Setting this option implies -dd.
              Size is in the format nm where n is a number and m is  a  multi-
              plier.  Currently m can be k (KB), m (MB), g (GB), or t (TB), so
              if n is 100 and m is k, size would be 100k which is 100 KB.  The
              default is 10 MB.

              The -v option also displays dots and now defaults to 10 MB also.
              This rate is also controlled by this option.  A size of 0  turns
              dots off.

              This  option does not control the dots from the "Scanning files"
              message as zip scans for input files.  The dot size for that  is
              fixed  at  2  seconds or a fixed number of entries, whichever is
              longer.

       -du
       --display-usize
              Display the uncompressed size of each entry.

       -dv
       --display-volume
              Display the volume (disk) number each entry is being read  from,
              if reading an existing archive, and being written to.

       -D
       --no-dir-entries
              Do  not  create  entries  in  the  zip  archive for directories.
              Directory  entries  are  created  by  default  so   that   their
              attributes  can  be  saved  in the zip archive.  The environment
              variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default  options.  For
              example under Unix with sh:

                     ZIPOPT="-D"; export ZIPOPT

              (The  variable  ZIPOPT  can be used for any option, including -i
              and -x using a new option format detailed below, and can include
              several  options.)  The option -D is a shorthand for -x "*/" but
              the latter previously could not be set as default in the  ZIPOPT
              environment  variable  as  the  contents of ZIPOPT gets inserted
              near the beginning of the command line and the file list had  to
              end at the end of the line.

              This  version  of  zip does allow -x and -i options in ZIPOPT if
              the form

               -x file file ... @

              is used, where the @ (an argument that is just @) terminates the
              list.

       -DF
       --difference-archive
              Create  an archive that contains all new and changed files since
              the original archive was created.  For this to work,  the  input
              file  list  and current directory must be the same as during the
              original zip operation.

              For example, if the existing archive was created using

                     zip -r foofull .

              from the bar directory, then the command

                     zip -r foofull . -DF --out foonew

              also from the bar directory creates the archive foonew with just
              the  files  not  in foofull and the files where the size or file
              time of the files do not match those in foofull.

              Note that the timezone environment variable  TZ  should  be  set
              according to the local timezone in order for this option to work
              correctly.  A change in timezone since the original archive  was
              created  could  result  in no times matching and all files being
              included.

              A possible approach to backing up a directory might be to create
              a  normal  archive  of  the  contents of the directory as a full
              backup, then use this option to create incremental backups.

       -e
       --encrypt
              Encrypt the contents of the zip archive using a  password  which
              is  entered  on  the terminal in response to a prompt (this will
              not be echoed; if standard error is not a  tty,  zip  will  exit
              with  an  error).   The  password prompt is repeated to save the
              user from typing errors.

       -E
       --longnames
              [OS/2] Use the .LONGNAME Extended Attribute (if found) as  filename.

       -f
       --freshen
              Replace  (freshen)  an existing entry in the zip archive only if
              it has been modified more recently than the version  already  in
              the zip archive; unlike the update option (-u) this will not add
              files that are not already in the zip archive.  For example:

                     zip -f foo

              This command should be run from the same  directory  from  which
              the  original zip command was run, since paths stored in zip archives
              are always relative.

              Note that the timezone environment variable  TZ  should  be  set
              according  to  the local timezone in order for the -f, -u and -o
              options to work correctly.

              The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do  with
              the  differences  between  the Unix-format file times (always in
              GMT) and most of the other operating systems (always local time)
              and  the  necessity  to  compare the two.  A typical TZ value is
              ''MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time  with  automatic  adjustment
              for ''summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).

              The  format is TTThhDDD, where TTT is the time zone such as MET,
              hh is the difference between GMT  and  local  time  such  as  -1
              above, and DDD is the time zone when daylight savings time is in
              effect.  Leave off the DDD if there is no daylight savings time.
              For the US Eastern time zone EST5EDT.

       -F
       --fix
       -FF
       --fixfix
              Fix  the zip archive. The -F option can be used if some portions
              of the archive are missing, but  requires  a  reasonably  intact
              central  directory.   The input archive is scanned as usual, but
              zip will ignore some problems.  The resulting archive should  be
              valid, but any inconsistent entries will be left out.

              When  doubled  as in -FF, the archive is scanned from the begin-
              ning and zip scans for special signatures to identify the limits
              between  the  archive members. The single -F is more reliable if
              the archive is not too much damaged, so try this option first.

              If the archive is too damaged or the end has been truncated, you
              must  use  -FF.   This  is  a change from zip 2.32, where the -F
              option is able to read a truncated archive.  The -F  option  now
              more  reliably  fixes  archives  with  minor  damage and the -FF
              option is needed to fix archives where -F might have been suffi-
              cient before.

              Neither  option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
              transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After  the  repair,
              the  -t option of unzip might show that some files have a bad CRC.
              Such files cannot be recovered; you can remove them from the ar-
              chive using the -d option of zip.

              Note  that  -FF can have trouble fixing archives that include an
              embedded zip archive that was stored  (without  compression)  in
              the  archive  and,  depending  on  the  damage,  it can find the
              entries in the embedded archive rather than the archive  itself.
              Try -F first as it does not have this problem.

              The  format  of  the fix commands have changed.  For example, to
              fix the damaged archive foo.zip,

                     zip -F foo --out foofix

              tries to read the entries normally, copying good entries to  the
              new  archive  foofix.zip.  If this doesn't work, as when the ar-
              chive is truncated, or if some entries you know are in  the  ar-
              chive are missed, then try

                     zip -FF foo --out foofixfix

              and  compare the resulting archive to the archive created by -F.
              The -FF option can create an inconsistent archive.  Depending on
              what  is damaged, you can then use the -F option to fix that ar-
              chive.

              A split archive with missing split files can be fixed  using  -F
              if  you  have the last split of the archive (the .zip file).  If
              this file is missing, you must use -FF to fix the archive, which
              will prompt you for the splits you have.

              Currently  the fix options can't recover entries that have a bad
              checksum or are otherwise damaged.

       -FI
       --fifo [Unix]  Normally zip  skips  reading  any  FIFOs  (named  pipes)
              encountered, as zip can hang if the FIFO is not being fed.  This
              option tells zip to read the contents of any FIFO it finds.

       -FS
       --filesync
              Synchronize the contents of an archive with the files on the OS.
              Normally  when  an  archive  is updated, new files are added and
              changed files are updated but files that no longer exist on  the
              OS  are not deleted from the archive.  This option enables a new
              mode that checks entries in the archive against the file system.
              If  the file time and file size of the entry matches that of the
              OS file, the entry is copied from the  old  archive  instead  of
              being  read from the file system and compressed.  If the OS file
              has changed, the entry is read and compressed as usual.  If  the
              entry  in the archive does not match a file on the OS, the entry
              is deleted.  Enabling this option should  create  archives  that
              are  the  same  as  new archives, but since existing entries are
              copied instead of compressed, updating an existing archive  with
              -FS  can  be much faster than creating a new archive.  Also con-
              sider using -u for updating an archive.

              For this option to work, the archive should be updated from  the
              same  directory  it  was created in so the relative paths match.
              If few files are being copied from the old archive,  it  can  be
              faster to create a new archive instead.

              Note  that  the  timezone  environment variable TZ should be set
              according to the local timezone in order for this option to work
              correctly.   A change in timezone since the original archive was
              created could result in no times matching and  recompression  of
              all files.

              This option deletes files from the archive.  If you need to pre-
              serve the original archive, make a copy of the archive first  or
              use  the  --out  option  to  output the updated archive to a new
              file.  Even though it might be slower, creating a new archive with
              a  new  archive name is safer, avoids mismatches between archive
              and OS paths, and is preferred.

       -g
       --grow
              Grow (append to) the specified zip archive, instead of  creating
              a  new one. If this operation fails, zip attempts to restore the
              archive to its original state. If the restoration fails, the ar-
              chive  might  become  corrupted.  This  option  is  ignored when
              there's no existing archive or when at least one archive  member
              must be updated or deleted.

       -h
       -?
       --help
              Display  the  zip  help information (this also appears if zip is
              run with no arguments).

       -h2
       --more-help
              Display extended help including more  on  command  line  format,
              pattern matching, and more obscure options.

       -i files
       --include files
              Include only the specified files, as in:

                     zip -r foo . -i \*.c

              which  will include only the files that end in .c in the current
              directory and its subdirectories. (Note  for  PKZIP  users:  the
              equivalent command is

                     pkzip -rP foo *.c

              PKZIP  does  not  allow  recursion in directories other than the
              current one.)  The backslash avoids the shell filename substitu-
              tion,  so  that  the  name  matching  is performed by zip at all
              directory levels.  [This is for Unix and other systems  where  \
              escapes  the  next character.  For other systems where the shell
              does not process * do not use \ and the above is

                     zip -r foo . -i *.c

              Examples are  for  Unix  unless  otherwise  specified.]   So  to
              include  dir,  a directory directly under the current directory,
              use

                     zip -r foo . -i dir/\*

              or

                     zip -r foo . -i "dir/*"

              to match paths such as dir/a and dir/b/file.c [on ports  without
              wildcard expansion in the shell such as MSDOS and Windows

                     zip -r foo . -i dir/*

              is  used.]   Note  that  currently  the trailing / is needed for
              directories (as in

                     zip -r foo . -i dir/

              to include directory dir).

              The long option form of the first example is

                     zip -r foo . --include \*.c

              and does the same thing as the short option form.

              Though the command syntax used to require -i at the end  of  the
              command  line,  this  version  actually allows -i (or --include)
              anywhere.  The list of files terminates  at  the  next  argument
              starting with -, the end of the command line, or the list termi-
              nator @ (an argument that is just @).  So the above can be given
              as

                     zip -i \*.c @ -r foo .

              for  example.   There must be a space between the option and the
              first file of a list.  For just one file you can use the  single
              value form

                     zip -i\*.c -r foo .

              (no space between option and value) or

                     zip --include=\*.c -r foo .

              as  additional  examples.  The single value forms are not recom-
              mended because they can be confusing  and,  in  particular,  the
              -ifile  format  can  cause  problems if the first letter of file
              combines with i to form a two-letter  option  starting  with  i.
              Use -sc to see how your command line will be parsed.

              Also possible:

                     zip -r foo  . -i@include.lst

              which  will  only include the files in the current directory and
              its  subdirectories  that  match  the  patterns  in   the   file
              include.lst.

              Files to -i and -x are patterns matching internal archive paths.
              See -R for more on patterns.

       -I
       --no-image
              [Acorn RISC OS] Don't scan through Image files.  When used,  zip
              will  not  consider Image files (eg. DOS partitions or Spark ar-
              chives when SparkFS is loaded) as  directories  but  will  store
              them as single files.

              For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark archive
              will result in a zipfile containing a directory  (and  its  con-
              tent)  while  using the 'I' option will result in a zipfile con-
              taining a Spark archive. Obviously this second case will also be
              obtained (without the 'I' option) if SparkFS isn't loaded.

       -ic
       --ignore-case
              [VMS,  WIN32]  Ignore  case when matching archive entries.  This
              option is only available on systems where the case of  files  is
              ignored.  On systems with case-insensitive file systems, case is
              normally ignored when matching files on the file system  but  is
              not  ignored for -f (freshen), -d (delete), -U (copy), and simi-
              lar modes when matching against archive  entries  (currently  -f
              ignores case on VMS) because archive entries can be from systems
              where case does matter and names that are the  same  except  for
              case can exist in an archive.  The -ic option makes all matching
              case insensitive.  This can result in multiple  archive  entries
              matching a command line pattern.

       -j
       --junk-paths
              Store  just the name of a saved file (junk the path), and do not
              store directory names. By default, zip will store the full  path
              (relative to the current directory).

       -jj
       --absolute-path
              [MacOS] record Fullpath (+ Volname). The complete path including
              volume will be stored. By default  the  relative  path  will  be
              stored.

       -J
       --junk-sfx
              Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the archive.

       -k
       --DOS-names
              Attempt  to  convert  the  names  and paths to conform to MSDOS,
              store only the MSDOS attribute (just the  user  write  attribute
              from  Unix), and mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though
              it was not); for compatibility with PKUNZIP  under  MSDOS  which
              cannot handle certain names such as those with two dots.

       -l
       --to-crlf
              Translate  the Unix end-of-line character LF into the MSDOS con-
              vention CR LF. This option should not be used on  binary  files.
              This  option can be used on Unix if the zip file is intended for
              PKUNZIP under MSDOS. If the input files already contain  CR  LF,
              this option adds an extra CR. This is to ensure that unzip -a on
              Unix will get back an exact copy of the original file,  to  undo
              the effect of zip -l.  See -ll for how binary files are handled.

       -la
       --log-append
              Append to existing logfile.  Default is to overwrite.

       -lf logfilepath
       --logfile-path logfilepath
              Open a logfile at the given path.  By default any existing  file
              at  that location is overwritten, but the -la option will result
              in an existing file being opened and  the  new  log  information
              appended  to any existing information.  Only warnings and errors
              are written to the log unless the -li option is also given, then
              all information messages are also written to the log.

       -li
       --log-info
              Include  information  messages, such as file names being zipped,
              in the log.  The default is to only include  the  command  line,
              any warnings and errors, and the final status.

       -ll
       --from-crlf
              Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.  This option
              should not be used on binary files.  This option can be used  on
              MSDOS  if the zip file is intended for unzip under Unix.  If the
              file is converted and the file is later determined to be  binary
              a warning is issued and the file is probably corrupted.  In this
              release if -ll detects binary in the first buffer  read  from  a
              file,  zip now issues a warning and skips line end conversion on
              the file.  This check seems to catch all  binary  files  tested,
              but  the original check remains and if a converted file is later
              determined to be binary that warning is  still  issued.   A  new
              algorithm  is  now  being  used for binary detection that should
              allow line end conversion of text files  in  UTF-8  and  similar
              encodings.

       -L
       --license
              Display the zip license.

       -m
       --move
              Move  the  specified  files into the zip archive; actually, this
              deletes the target directories/files after making the  specified
              zip  archive.  If a directory becomes empty after removal of the
              files, the directory is also  removed.  No  deletions  are  done
              until zip has created the archive without error.  This is useful
              for conserving disk space, but is potentially dangerous so it is
              recommended to use it in combination with -T to test the archive
              before removing all input files.

       -MM
       --must-match
              All input patterns must match at least one file  and  all  input
              files  found  must  be readable.  Normally when an input pattern
              does not match a file the "name not matched" warning  is  issued
              and  when  an  input file has been found but later is missing or
              not readable a missing or not readable warning  is  issued.   In
              either  case zip continues creating the archive, with missing or
              unreadable new files being skipped and files already in the  ar-
              chive remaining unchanged.  After the archive is created, if any
              files were not readable zip returns the OPEN error code  (18  on
              most  systems)  instead  of the normal success return (0 on most
              systems).  With -MM set, zip exits as soon as an  input  pattern
              is not matched (whenever the "name not matched" warning would be
              issued) or when an input file is not readable.  In  either  case
              zip exits with an OPEN error and no archive is created.

              This option is useful when a known list of files is to be zipped
              so any missing or unreadable files will result in an error.   It
              is less useful when used with wildcards, but zip will still exit
              with an error if any input pattern doesn't match  at  least  one
              file  and  if  any matched files are unreadable.  If you want to
              create the archive anyway and only need to know  if  files  were
              skipped, don't use -MM and just check the return code.  Also -lf
              could be useful.

       -n suffixes
       --suffixes suffixes
              Do not attempt to compress files named with the given  suffixes.
              Such files are stored (0% compression) in the output zip file,
              so that zip doesn't waste  its  time  trying  to  compress them.
              The  suffixes  are  separated  by either colons or semi- colons.
              For example:

                   zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo

              will copy everything from foo into foo.zip, but will  store  any
              files  that end in .Z, .zip, .tiff, .gif, or .snd without trying
              to compress them (image and sound files  often  have  their  own
              specialized compression methods).  By default, zip does not com-
              press     files     with     extensions     in     the      list
              .Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.   Such files are stored directly in
              the output archive.  The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used
              to change the default options. For example under Unix with csh:

                   setenv ZIPOPT "-n .gif:.zip"

              To attempt compression on all files, use:

                   zip -n : foo

              The maximum  compression option -9 also attempts compression on
              all files regardless of extension.

              On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes  (3
              hex  digit format). By default, zip does not compress files with
              filetypes in the list DDC:D96:68E (i.e. Archives, CFS files  and
              PackDir files).

       -nw
       --no-wild
              Do not perform internal wildcard processing (shell processing of
              wildcards is still done by the shell unless  the  arguments  are
              escaped).   Useful if a list of paths is being read and no wild-
              card substitution is desired.

       -N
       --notes
              [Amiga, MacOS] Save Amiga or MacOS  filenotes  as  zipfile  com-
              ments.  They can be restored by using the -N option of unzip. If
              -c is used also, you are prompted for comments  only  for  those
              files that do not have filenotes.

       -o
       --latest-time
              Set  the  "last  modified" time of the zip archive to the latest
              (oldest) "last modified" time found among the entries in the zip
              archive. This  can  be  used  without any other operations, if
              desired. For example:

              zip -o foo

              will change the last modified time of foo.zip to the latest time
              of the entries in foo.zip.

       -O output-file
       --output-file output-file
              Process  the  archive  changes as usual, but instead of updating
              the existing archive, output the  new  archive  to  output-file.
              Useful for updating an archive without changing the existing ar-
              chive and the input archive must be a different  file  than  the
              output archive.

              This  option  can  be used to create updated split archives.  It
              can also be used with -U to copy entries from  an  existing  ar-
              chive to a new archive.  See the EXAMPLES section below.

              Another  use  is  converting  zip  files  from one split size to
              another.  For instance, to convert an archive  with  700  MB  CD
              splits to one with 2 GB DVD splits, can use:

                     zip -s 2g cd-split.zip --out dvd-split.zip

              which uses copy mode.  See -U below.  Also:

                     zip -s 0 split.zip --out unsplit.zip

              will convert a split archive to a single-file archive.

              Copy  mode  will  convert stream entries (using data descriptors
              and which should be  compatible  with  most  unzips)  to  normal
              entries  (which should be compatible with all unzips), except if
              standard encryption  was  used.   For  archives  with  encrypted
              entries,  zipcloak  will decrypt the entries and convert them to
              normal entries.

       -p
       --paths
              Include relative file paths as part of the names of files stored
              in  the  archive.  This is the default.  The -j option junks the
              paths and just stores the names of the files.

       -P password
       --password password
              Use password to encrypt zipfile entries (if any).  THIS IS INSE-
              CURE!   Many  multi-user  operating systems provide ways for any
              user to see the current command line of any other user; even  on
              stand-alone  systems  there  is  always  the threat of over-the-
              shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext password as part  of  a
              command  line  in  an  automated script is even worse.  Whenever
              possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter pass-
              words.   (And  where  security  is  truly  important, use strong
              encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively
              weak standard encryption provided by zipfile utilities.)

       -q
       --quiet
              Quiet   mode;   eliminate  informational  messages  and  comment
              prompts.  (Useful, for example, in shell scripts and  background
              tasks).

       -Qn
       --Q-flag n
              [QDOS]  store information about the file in the file header with
              n defined as
              bit  0: Don't add headers for any file
              bit  1: Add headers for all files
              bit  2: Don't wait for interactive key press on exit

       -r
       --recurse-paths
              Travel the directory structure recursively; for example:

                     zip -r foo.zip foo

              or more concisely

                     zip -r foo foo

              In this case, all the files and directories in foo are saved  in
              a zip archive named foo.zip, including files with names starting
              with ".", since the recursion does not use the shell's file-name
              substitution  mechanism.  If you wish to include only a specific
              subset of the files in directory foo and its subdirectories, use
              the  -i  option  to specify the pattern of files to be included.
              You should not use -r with the name  ".*",  since  that  matches
              ".."   which will attempt to zip up the parent directory (proba-
              bly not what was intended).

              Multiple source directories are allowed as in

                     zip -r foo foo1 foo2

              which first zips up foo1 and then foo2, going down  each  direc-
              tory.

              Note  that  while  wildcards  to -r are typically resolved while
              recursing down directories in the file system, any -R,  -x,  and
              -i  wildcards are applied to internal archive pathnames once the
              directories are scanned.  To have wildcards apply  to  files  in
              subdirectories  when recursing on Unix and similar systems where
              the shell does wildcard substitution, either  escape  all  wild-
              cards  or put all arguments with wildcards in quotes.  This lets
              zip see the wildcards and match files  in  subdirectories  using
              them as it recurses.

       -R
       --recurse-patterns
              Travel  the directory structure recursively starting at the cur-
              rent directory; for example:

                     zip -R foo "*.c"

              In this case, all the files matching *.c in the tree starting at
              the  current  directory  are  stored  into  a  zip archive named
              foo.zip.  Note that *.c will match file.c, a/file.c and  a/b/.c.
              More than one pattern can be listed as separate arguments.  Note
              for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is

                     pkzip -rP foo *.c

              Patterns are relative file paths as they appear in the  archive,
              or  will after zipping, and can have optional wildcards in them.
              For example, given the current directory is foo and under it are
              directories foo1 and foo2 and in foo1 is the file bar.c,

                     zip -R foo/*

              will zip up foo, foo/foo1, foo/foo1/bar.c, and foo/foo2.

                     zip -R */bar.c

              will  zip  up  foo/foo1/bar.c.   See the note for -r on escaping
              wildcards.


       -RE
       --regex
              [WIN32]  Before zip 3.0, regular expression  list  matching  was
              enabled  by  default on Windows platforms.  Because of confusion
              resulting from the need to escape "[" and "]" in  names,  it  is
              now  off  by  default for Windows so "[" and "]" are just normal
              characters in names.  This option enables [] matching again.


       -s splitsize
       --split-size splitsize
              Enable creating a split archive and set the split size.  A split
              archive  is  an archive that could be split over many files.  As
              the archive is created, if the size of the archive  reaches  the
              specified  split  size,  that split is closed and the next split
              opened.  In general all splits but the last will  be  the  split
              size  and  the last will be whatever is left.  If the entire ar-
              chive is smaller than the split size a  single-file  archive  is
              created.

              Split  archives  are  stored in numbered files.  For example, if
              the output  archive  is  named  archive  and  three  splits  are
              required,  the  resulting archive will be in the three files ar-
              chive.z01, archive.z02, and archive.zip.  Do not change the num-
              bering  of  these  files  or the archive will not be readable as
              these are used to determine the order the splits are read.

              Split size is a number  optionally  followed  by  a  multiplier.
              Currently  the  number  must  be an integer.  The multiplier can
              currently be one of k (kilobytes), m (megabytes), g (gigabytes),
              or  t  (terabytes).   As  64k is the minimum split size, numbers
              without multipliers default to megabytes.  For example, to  cre-
              ate  a  split  archive  called  foo with the contents of the bar
              directory with splits of 670 MB that might be useful for burning
              on CDs, the command:

                     zip -s 670m -r foo bar

              could be used.

              Currently  the  old  splits  of a split archive are not excluded
              from a new archive, but they can be specifically  excluded.   If
              possible,  keep  the  input  and output archives out of the path
              being zipped when creating split archives.

              Using -s without -sp as above creates all the splits  where  foo
              is  being  written,  in  this  case the current directory.  This
              split mode updates the splits as the archive is  being  created,
              requiring  all  splits to remain writable, but creates split ar-
              chives that are readable by any unzip that  supports  split  ar-
              chives.   See  -sp  below  for  enabling  split pause mode which
              allows splits to be written directly to removable media.

              The option -sv can be used to enable verbose splitting and  pro-
              vide details of how the splitting is being done.  The -sb option
              can be used to ring the bell when zip pauses for the next  split
              destination.

              Split  archives cannot be updated, but see the -O (--out) option
              for how a split archive can be updated as it is copied to a  new
              archive.   A  split archive can also be converted into a single-
              file archive using a split size of 0 or negating the -s option:

                     zip -s 0 split.zip --out single.zip

              Also see -U (--copy) for more on using copy mode.

       -sb
       --split-bell
              If splitting and using split pause mode, ring the bell when  zip
              pauses for each split destination.

       -sc
       --show-command
              Show  the  command line starting zip as processed and exit.  The
              new command parser permutes the arguments, putting  all  options
              and  any values associated with them before any non-option argu-
              ments.  This allows an option to appear anywhere in the  command
              line  as  long as any values that go with the option go with it.
              This option displays the command line as zip sees it,  including
              any arguments from the environment such as from the ZIPOPT vari-
              able.  Where allowed, options later  in  the  command  line  can
              override options earlier in the command line.

       -sf
       --show-files
              Show  the  files  that  would  be  operated  on, then exit.  For
              instance, if creating a new archive, this will  list  the  files
              that  would  be  added.   If the option is negated, -sf-, output
              only to an open log file.  Screen display is not recommended for
              large lists.

       -so
       --show-options
              Show  all  available options supported by zip as compiled on the
              current system.  As this command  reads  the  option  table,  it
              should include all options.  Each line includes the short option
              (if defined), the long option (if defined), the  format  of  any
              value  that  goes with the option, if the option can be negated,
              and a small description.  The value  format  can  be  no  value,
              required  value,  optional value, single character value, number
              value, or a list of values.  The output of this  option  is  not
              intended  to  show  how  to  use  any  option but only show what
              options are available.

       -sp
       --split-pause
              If splitting is enabled with -s, enable split pause mode.   This
              creates split archives as -s does, but stream writing is used so
              each split can be closed as soon as it is written and  zip  will
              pause  between each split to allow changing split destination or
              media.

              Though this split mode allows writing splits directly to  remov-
              able  media, it uses stream archive format that might not be read-
              able by some unzips.  Before relying on splits created with -sp,
              test a split archive with the unzip you will be using.

              To  convert a stream split archive (created with -sp) to a stan-
              dard archive see the --out option.

       -su
       --show-unicode
              As -sf, but also show Unicode version of the path if exists.

       -sU
       --show-just-unicode
              As -sf, but only show Unicode version of  the  path  if  exists,
              otherwise show the standard version of the path.

       -sv
       --split-verbose
              Enable various verbose messages while splitting, showing how the
              splitting is being done.

       -S
       --system-hidden
              [MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32 and ATARI] Include system and hidden  files.
              [MacOS]  Includes finder invisible files, which are ignored oth-
              erwise.

       -t mmddyyyy
       --from-date mmddyyyy
              Do not operate on files modified prior to  the  specified  date,
              where  mm  is  the  month  (00-12),  dd  is the day of the month
              (01-31), and  yyyy  is  the  year.   The  ISO 8601  date  format
              yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted.  For example:

                     zip -rt 12071991 infamy foo

                     zip -rt 1991-12-07 infamy foo

              will  add  all the files in foo and its subdirectories that were
              last modified on or after 7 December 1991, to  the  zip  archive
              infamy.zip.

       -tt mmddyyyy
       --before-date mmddyyyy
              Do not operate on files modified after or at the specified date,
              where mm is the month (00-12),  dd  is  the  day  of  the  month
              (01-31),  and  yyyy  is  the  year.   The  ISO 8601  date format
              yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted.  For example:

                     zip -rtt 11301995 infamy foo

                     zip -rtt 1995-11-30 infamy foo

              will add all the files in foo and its subdirectories  that  were
              last  modified  before  30  November  1995,  to  the zip archive
              infamy.zip.

       -T
       --test
              Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails,  the
              old  zip  file  is  unchanged  and (with the -m option) no input
              files are removed.

       -TT cmd
       --unzip-command cmd
              Use command cmd instead of 'unzip -tqq' to test an archive  when
              the  -T  option is used.  On Unix, to use a copy of unzip in the
              current directory instead of the standard  system  unzip,  could
              use:

               zip archive file1 file2 -T -TT "./unzip -tqq"

              In  cmd,  {}  is  replaced by the name of the temporary archive,
              otherwise the name of the archive is appended to the end of  the
              command.  The return code is checked for success (0 on Unix).

       -u
       --update
              Replace (update) an existing entry in the zip archive only if it
              has been modified more recently than the version already in  the
              zip archive.  For example:

                     zip -u stuff *

              will  add any new files in the current directory, and update any
              files which have been modified since the zip  archive  stuff.zip
              was  last  created/modified  (note that zip will not try to pack
              stuff.zip into itself when you do this).

              Note that the -u option with no input file arguments  acts  like
              the -f (freshen) option.

       -U
       --copy-entries
              Copy  entries  from  one archive to another.  Requires the --out
              option to specify a different output file  than  the  input  ar-
              chive.   Copy  mode is the reverse of -d delete.  When delete is
              being used with --out, the selected entries are deleted from the
              archive  and  all  other  entries are copied to the new archive,
              while copy mode selects the files to include in the new archive.
              Unlike -u update, input patterns on the command line are matched
              against archive entries only and not the file system files.  For
              instance,

                     zip inarchive "*.c" --copy --out outarchive

              copies  entries  with  names ending in .c from inarchive to out-
              archive.  The wildcard must be escaped on some systems  to  pre-
              vent  the  shell  from substituting names of files from the file
              system which can have no relevance to the  entries  in  the  ar-
              chive.

              If  no input files appear on the command line and --out is used,
              copy mode is assumed:

                     zip inarchive --out outarchive

              This is useful for changing split size for instance.  Encrypting
              and  decrypting  entries  is  not yet supported using copy mode.
              Use zipcloak for that.

       -UN v
       --unicode v
              Determine what zip should do with Unicode file names.   zip 3.0,
              in  addition  to  the standard file path, now includes the UTF-8
              translation of the path if the entry path is not entirely  7-bit
              ASCII.   When  an entry is missing the Unicode path, zip reverts
              back to the standard file path.   The  problem  with  using  the
              standard  path is this path is in the local character set of the
              zip that created the entry, which can  contain  characters  that
              are  not  valid  in  the  character set being used by the unzip.
              When zip is reading an archive, if an entry also has  a  Unicode
              path, zip now defaults to using the Unicode path to recreate the
              standard path using the current local character set.

              This option can be used to determine what  zip  should  do  with
              this  path  if  there  is a mismatch between the stored standard
              path and the stored UTF-8 path (which can happen if the standard
              path  was  updated).  In all cases, if there is a mismatch it is
              assumed that the standard path is  more  current  and  zip  uses
              that.  Values for v are:

                     q - quit if paths do not match

                     w - warn, continue with standard path

                     i - ignore, continue with standard path

                     n - no Unicode, do not use Unicode paths

              The default is to warn and continue.

              Characters  that  are not valid in the current character set are
              escaped as #Uxxxx and #Lxxxxxx, where x is  an  ASCII  character
              for a hex digit.  The first is used if a 16-bit character number
              is sufficient to represent the Unicode character and the  second
              if  the character needs more than 16 bits to represent it's Uni-
              code character code.  Setting -UN to

                     e - escape

              as in

                     zip archive -sU -UN=e

              forces zip to escape all characters that are not printable 7-bit
              ASCII.

              Normally zip stores UTF-8 directly in the standard path field on
              systems where UTF-8 is the current character set and stores  the
              UTF-8 in the new extra fields otherwise.  The option

                     u - UTF-8

              as in

                     zip archive dir -r -UN=UTF8

              forces  zip  to store UTF-8 as native in the archive.  Note that
              storing UTF-8 directly is the default on Unix systems that  sup-
              port  it.   This option could be useful on Windows systems where
              the escaped path is too large to be a valid path and  the  UTF-8
              version of the path is smaller, but native UTF-8 is not backward
              compatible on Windows systems.


       -v
       --verbose
              Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.

              Normally, when applied to real operations, this  option  enables
              the  display of a progress indicator during compression (see -dd
              for more on dots) and requests  verbose  diagnostic  info  about
              zipfile structure oddities.

              However,  when -v is the only command line argument a diagnostic
              screen is printed instead.  This should now work even if  stdout
              is redirected to a file, allowing easy saving of the information
              for sending with bug reports to Info-ZIP.   The  version  screen
              provides  the help screen header with program name, version, and
              release date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP home  and  distribu-
              tion  sites,  and shows information about the target environment
              (compiler type and version, OS version, compilation date and the
              enabled optional features used to create the zip executable).

       -V
       --VMS-portable
              [VMS]  Save VMS file attributes.  (Files are  truncated at EOF.)
              When a -V archive is unpacked on a non-VMS  system,   some  file
              types  (notably  Stream_LF  text  files   and  pure binary files
              like fixed-512) should be extracted intact.  Indexed  files  and
              file  types  with embedded record sizes (notably variable-length
              record types) will probably be seen as corrupt elsewhere.

       -VV
       --VMS-specific
              [VMS] Save VMS file attributes, and  all allocated blocks  in  a
              file,   including  any  data beyond EOF.  Useful for moving ill-
              formed files  among   VMS  systems.    When  a  -VV  archive  is
              unpacked  on a non-VMS system, almost all files will appear cor-
              rupt.

       -w
       --VMS-versions
              [VMS] Append the version  number  of  the  files  to  the  name,
              including  multiple  versions  of files.  Default is to use only
              the most recent version of a specified file.

       -ww
       --VMS-dot-versions
              [VMS] Append the version  number  of  the  files  to  the  name,
              including  multiple  versions  of  files, using the .nnn format.
              Default is to use only the most recent version  of  a  specified
              file.

       -ws
       --wild-stop-dirs
              Wildcards match only at a directory level.  Normally zip handles
              paths as strings and given the paths

                     /foo/bar/dir/file1.c

                     /foo/bar/file2.c

              an input pattern such as

                     /foo/bar/*

              normally would match both paths, the * matching dir/file1.c  and
              file2.c.   Note  that in the first case a directory boundary (/)
              was crossed in the match.  With -ws no directory bounds will  be
              included  in  the  match,  making  wildcards local to a specific
              directory level.  So, with -ws enabled,  only  the  second  path
              would be matched.

              When using -ws, use ** to match across directory boundaries as *
              does normally.

       -x files
       --exclude files
              Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:

                     zip -r foo foo -x \*.o

              which will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while  exclud-
              ing  all  the  files  that  end in .o.  The backslash avoids the
              shell filename substitution, so that the name matching  is  per-
              formed by zip at all directory levels.

              Also possible:

                     zip -r foo foo -x@exclude.lst

              which  will include the contents of foo in foo.zip while exclud-
              ing  all  the  files  that  match  the  patterns  in  the   file
              exclude.lst.

              The long option forms of the above are

                     zip -r foo foo --exclude \*.o

              and

                     zip -r foo foo --exclude @exclude.lst

              Multiple patterns can be specified, as in:

                     zip -r foo foo -x \*.o \*.c

              If  there is no space between -x and the pattern, just one value
              is assumed (no list):

                     zip -r foo foo -x\*.o


              See -i for more on include and exclude.

       -X
       --no-extra
              Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on  OS/2,
              uid/gid  and  file  times  on  Unix).  The zip format uses extra
              fields to include additional information for each  entry.   Some
              extra fields are specific to particular systems while others are
              applicable to all systems.  Normally when zip reads entries from
              an  existing archive, it reads the extra fields it knows, strips
              the rest, and adds the extra fields applicable to  that  system.
              With -X, zip strips all old fields and only includes the Unicode
              and Zip64 extra fields (currently these two extra fields  cannot
              be disabled).

              Negating  this  option,  -X-,  includes  all  the  default extra
              fields, but also copies over any unrecognized extra fields.

       -y
       --symlinks
              For UNIX and VMS (V8.3 and later), store symbolic links as  such
              in  the zip archive, instead of compressing and storing the file
              referred to by the link.  This  can  avoid  multiple  copies  of
              files  being  included in the archive as zip recurses the direc-
              tory trees and accesses files directly and by links.

       -z
       --archive-comment
              Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire zip archive.  The
              comment  is  ended by a line containing just a period, or an end
              of file condition (^D on Unix, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS).  The
              comment can be taken from a file:

                     zip -z foo < foowhat

       -Z cm
       --compression-method cm
              Set  the default compression method.  Currently the main methods
              supported by zip are store and deflate.  Compression method  can
              be set to:

              store  -  Setting  the compression method to store forces zip to
              store entries with no compression.   This  is  generally  faster
              than compressing entries, but results in no space savings.  This
              is the same as using -0 (compression level zero).

              deflate - This is the default method for zip.  If zip determines
              that  storing is better than deflation, the entry will be stored
              instead.

              bzip2 - If bzip2 support is compiled in, this compression method
              also  becomes available.  Only some modern unzips currently sup-
              port the bzip2 compression method, so test the unzip you will be
              using  before relying on archives using this method (compression
              method 12).

              For example, to add bar.c to archive foo  using  bzip2  compres-
              sion:

                     zip -Z bzip2 foo bar.c

              The compression method can be abbreviated:

                     zip -Zb foo bar.c


       -#
       (-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9)
              Regulate  the  speed of compression using the specified digit #,
              where -0 indicates no compression (store all  files),  -1  indi-
              cates  the  fastest  compression speed (less compression) and -9
              indicates the slowest compression  speed  (optimal  compression,
              ignores the suffix list). The default compression level is -6.

              Though  still  being  worked, the intention is this setting will
              control compression speed for  all  compression  methods.   Cur-
              rently only deflation is controlled.

       -!
       --use-privileges
              [WIN32]  Use  priviliges  (if  granted) to obtain all aspects of
              WinNT security.

       -@
       --names-stdin
              Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one file-
              name per line.

       -$
       --volume-label
              [MSDOS,  OS/2,  WIN32]  Include  the  volume label for the drive
              holding the first file to be compressed.  If you want to include
              only  the  volume  label  or  to force a specific drive, use the
              drive name as first file name, as in:

                     zip -$ foo a: c:barUSECommand format.  The basic command format is

              zip options archive inpath inpath ...

       where  archive  is a new or existing zip archive and inpath is a direc-
       tory or file path optionally including wildcards.  When given the  name
       of  an existing zip archive, zip will replace identically named entries
       in the zip archive (matching the relative names as stored  in  the  ar-
       chive)  or  add  entries for new names.  For example, if foo.zip exists
       and contains foo/file1 and foo/file2, and the  directory  foo  contains
       the files foo/file1 and foo/file3, then:

              zip -r foo.zip foo

       or more concisely

              zip -r foo foo

       will  replace foo/file1 in foo.zip and add foo/file3 to foo.zip.  After
       this,  foo.zip  contains  foo/file1,  foo/file2,  and  foo/file3,  with
       foo/file2 unchanged from before.

       So if before the zip command is executed foo.zip has:

               foo/file1 foo/file2

       and directory foo has:

               file1 file3

       then foo.zip will have:

               foo/file1 foo/file2 foo/file3

       where foo/file1 is replaced and foo/file3 is new.

       -@ file lists.   If  a file list is specified as -@ [Not on MacOS], zip
       takes the list of input files from standard input instead of  from  the
       command line.  For example,

              zip -@ foo

       will store the files listed one per line on stdin in foo.zip.

       Under  Unix,  this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction
       with the find (1) command.  For example, to archive all  the  C  source
       files in the current directory and its subdirectories:

              find . -name "*.[ch]" -print | zip source -@

       (note  that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding
       it).

       Streaming input and output.  zip will also accept a single  dash  ("-")
       as the zip file name, in which case it will write the zip file to stan-
       dard output, allowing the output to be piped to  another  program.  For
       example:

              zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k

       would  write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block
       size for the purpose of backing up the current directory.

       zip also accepts a single dash ("-") as the name of a file to  be  com-
       pressed,  in  which  case  it  will  read the file from standard input,
       allowing zip to take input from another program. For example:

              tar cf - . | zip backup -

       would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing
       up  the  current  directory. This generally produces better compression
       than the previous example using the -r  option  because  zip  can  take
       advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored using
       the command

              unzip -p backup | tar xf -

       When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,  zip  acts
       as  a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.  For exam-
       ple,

              tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k

       is equivalent to

              tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k

       zip archives created in this manner can be extracted with  the  program
       funzip  which  is  provided in the unzip package, or by gunzip which is
       provided in the gzip package (but some gunzip do not support this if
       zip used the Zip64 extensions). For example:

              dd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -

       The stream can also be saved to a file and unzip used.

       If  Zip64  support  for  large files and archives is enabled and zip is
       used as a filter, zip creates a Zip64 archive that requires a PKZIP 4.5
       or  later compatible unzip to read it.  This is to avoid amgibuities in
       the zip file structure as defined in the current zip  standard  (PKWARE
       AppNote)  where  the decision to use Zip64 needs to be made before data
       is written for the entry, but for a stream the size of the data is  not
       known at that point.  If the data is known to be smaller than 4 GB, the
       option -fz- can be used to prevent use of Zip64, but zip will exit with
       an  error if Zip64 was in fact needed.  zip 3 and unzip 6 and later can
       read archives with Zip64 entries.  Also, zip removes the  Zip64  exten-
       sions  if  not  needed  when  archive  entries  are  copied (see the -U
       (--copy) option).

       When directing the output to another file, note that all options should
       be before the redirection including -x.  For example:

              zip archive "*.h" "*.c" -x donotinclude.h orthis.h > tofile

       Zip files.   When  changing  an  existing zip archive, zip will write a
       temporary file with the new contents, and only replace the old one when
       the  process  of  creating  the  new version has been completed without
       error.

       If the name of the zip archive  does  not  contain  an  extension,  the
       extension  .zip  is  added.  If  the name already contains an extension
       other than .zip, the existing extension is  kept  unchanged.   However,
       split  archives  (archives  split over multiple files) require the .zip
       extension on the last split.

       Scanning and reading files.  When zip starts, it  scans  for  files  to
       process  (if  needed).  If this scan takes longer than about 5 seconds,
       zip will display  a  "Scanning  files"  message  and  start  displaying
       progress  dots  every  2  seconds  or  every so many entries processed,
       whichever takes longer.  If there is more than 2 seconds  between  dots
       it  could indicate that finding each file is taking time and could mean
       a slow network connection for example.  (Actually the initial file scan
       is  a  two-step  process where the directory scan is followed by a sort
       and these two steps are separated with a space in the dots.  If  updat-
       ing an existing archive, a space also appears between the existing file
       scan and the new file scan.)  The scanning  files  dots  are  not  con-
       trolled  by the -ds dot size option, but the dots are turned off by the
       -q quiet option.  The -sf show files option can be  used  to  scan  for
       files  and  get  the  list of files scanned without actually processing
       them.

       If zip is not able to read a file, it issues a warning  but  continues.
       See  the -MM option below for more on how zip handles patterns that are
       not matched and files that  are  not  readable.   If  some  files  were
       skipped, a warning is issued at the end of the zip operation noting how
       many files were read and how many skipped.

       Command modes.  zip now supports two distinct types of  command  modes,
       external  and  internal.  The external modes (add, update, and freshen)
       read files from the file system (as well as from an  existing  archive)
       while  the  internal  modes  (delete  and  copy) operate exclusively on
       entries in an existing archive.


       add
              Update existing entries and add new files.  If the archive  does
              not exist create it.  This is the default mode.

       update (-u)
              Update  existing entries if newer on the file system and add new
              files.  If the archive does not exist issue warning then  create
              a new archive.

       freshen (-f)
              Update  existing entries of an archive if newer on the file sys-
              tem.  Does not add new files to the archive.

       delete (-d)
              Select entries in an existing archive and delete them.

       copy (-U)
              Select entries in an existing archive and copy them to a new ar-
              chive.  This new mode is similar to update but command line pat-
              terns select entries in the existing archive rather  than  files
              from  the  file system and it uses the --out option to write the
              resulting archive to a new file rather than update the  existing
              archive, leaving the original archive unchanged.

       The new File Sync option (-FS) is also considered a new mode, though it
       is similar to update.  This mode  synchronizes  the  archive  with  the
       files  on  the OS, only replacing files in the archive if the file time
       or size of the OS file is different, adding  new  files,  and  deleting
       entries from the archive where there is no matching file.  As this mode
       can delete entries from the archive, consider making a backup  copy  of
       the archive.

       Also see -DF for creating difference archives.

       See  each option description below for details and the EXAMPLES section
       below for examples.

       Split archives.  zip version 3.0 and later can create  split  archives.
       A  split  archive  is a standard zip archive split over multiple files.
       (Note that split archives are not just archives split in to pieces,  as
       the  offsets of entries are now based on the start of each split.  Con-
       catenating the pieces together will invalidate these offsets, but unzip
       can  usually  deal  with it.  zip will usually refuse to process such a
       spliced archive unless the -FF fix option is used to fix the  offsets.)

       One use of split archives is storing a large archive on multiple remov-
       able media.  For a split archive with 20 split files the files are typ-
       ically  named  (replace  ARCHIVE  with  the  name  of your archive) AR-
       CHIVE.z01, ARCHIVE.z02, ..., ARCHIVE.z19, ARCHIVE.zip.  Note  that  the
       last  file  is  the  .zip  file.  In contrast, spanned archives are the
       original multi-disk archive generally requiring floppy disks and  using
       volume  labels  to store disk numbers.  zip supports split archives but
       not spanned archives, though a procedure exists  for  converting  split
       archives  of  the  right size to spanned archives.  The reverse is also
       true, where each file of a spanned archive can be copied  in  order  to
       files with the above names to create a split archive.

       Use  -s  to set the split size and create a split archive.  The size is
       given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB),
       or  t (TB) (the default is m).  The -sp option can be used to pause zip
       between splits to allow changing removable media, for example, but read
       the descriptions and warnings for both -s and -sp below.

       Though  zip does not update split archives, zip provides the new option
       -O (--output-file or --out) to allow split archives to be  updated  and
       saved in a new archive.  For example,

              zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip

       reads  archive  inarchive.zip,  even if split, adds the files foo.c and
       bar.c, and writes the resulting archive to  outarchive.zip.   If  inar-
       chive.zip is split then outarchive.zip defaults to the same split size.
       Be aware that if outarchive.zip and any split files  that  are  created
       with  it  already exist, these are always overwritten as needed without
       warning.  This might be changed in the future.

       Unicode.  Though the zip standard requires storing paths in an  archive
       using  a  specific character set, in practice zips have stored paths in
       archives in whatever the local character set is.  This creates problems
       when  an  archive is created or updated on a system using one character
       set and then extracted on another system using  a  different  character
       set.  When compiled with Unicode support enabled on platforms that sup-
       port wide characters, zip now stores, in addition to the standard local
       path  for  backward  compatibility,  the UTF-8 translation of the path.
       This provides a common universal character set for storing  paths  that
       allows  these paths to be fully extracted on other systems that support
       Unicode and to match as close as possible on systems that don't.

       On Win32 systems where paths are internally stored as Unicode but  rep-
       resented in the local character set, it's possible that some paths will
       be skipped during a local character set directory scan.  zip with  Uni-
       code support now can read and store these paths.  Note that Win 9x sys-
       tems and FAT file systems don't fully support Unicode.

       Be aware that console windows on Win32 and Unix, for example, sometimes
       don't  accurately  show all characters due to how each operating system
       switches in character sets for display.  However, directory  navigation
       tools should show the correct paths if the needed fonts are loaded.

       Command line format.  This version of zip has updated command line pro-
       cessing and support for long options.

       Short options take the form

              -s[-][s[-]...][value][=value][ value]

       where s is a one or two character short option.  A  short  option  that
       takes  a value is last in an argument and anything after it is taken as
       the value.  If the option can be negated and  "-"  immediately  follows
       the  option, the option is negated.  Short options can also be given as
       separate arguments

              -s[-][value][=value][ value] -s[-][value][=value][ value] ...

       Short options in general take values either as part of the  same  argu-
       ment  or  as  the following argument.  An optional = is also supported.
       So

              -ttmmddyyyy

       and

              -tt=mmddyyyy

       and

              -tt mmddyyyy

       all work.  The -x and -i options accept  lists  of  values  and  use  a
       slightly  different format described below.  See the -x and -i options.

       Long options take the form

              --longoption[-][=value][ value]

       where the option starts with --, has a multicharacter name, can include
       a  trailing  dash to negate the option (if the option supports it), and
       can have a value (option argument) specified by preceeding  it  with  =
       (no spaces).  Values can also follow the argument.  So

              --before-date=mmddyyyy

       and

              --before-date mmddyyyy

       both work.

       Long option names can be shortened to the shortest unique abbreviation.
       See the option descriptions below for which support long  options.   To
       avoid confusion, avoid abbreviating a negatable option with an embedded
       dash ("-") at the dash if you plan to negate it (the parser would  con-
       sider  a  trailing  dash,  such  as  for the option --some-option using
       --some- as the option, as part of  the  name  rather  than  a  negating
       dash).   This  can  be  changed to force the last dash in --some- to be
       negating in the future.

EXAMPLES

       The simplest example:

              zip stuff *

       creates the archive stuff.zip (assuming it does not exist) and puts all
       the  files in the current directory in it, in compressed form (the .zip
       suffix is added automatically, unless the archive name contains  a  dot
       already; this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).

       Because  of the way the shell on Unix does filename substitution, files
       starting with "." are not included; to include these as well:

              zip stuff .* *

       To create a password protected archive:

              zip -e stuff.zip file1 file2

       Even this will not include any subdirectories from the  current  direc-
       tory.

       To zip up an entire directory, the command:

              zip -r foo foo

       creates  the  archive foo.zip, containing all the files and directories
       in the directory foo that is contained within the current directory.

       You might want to make a zip archive that  contains  the  files  in  foo,
       without  recording  the directory name, foo.  You can use the -j option
       to leave off the paths, as in:

              zip -j foo foo/*

       If you are short on disk space, you might not have enough room to  hold
       both  the  original  directory and the corresponding compressed zip ar-
       chive.  In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the  -m
       option.   If  foo contains the subdirectories tom, dick, and harry, you
       can:

              zip -rm foo foo/tom
              zip -rm foo foo/dick
              zip -rm foo foo/harry

       where the first command creates foo.zip, and the next two  add  to  it.
       At  the  completion  of  each  zip command, the last created archive is
       deleted, making room for the next zip command to function.


       Use -s to set the split size and create a split archive.  The  size  is
       given as a number followed optionally by one of k (kB), m (MB), g (GB),
       or t (TB).  The command

              zip -s 2g -r split.zip foo

       creates a split archive of the directory foo with splits no bigger than
       2 GB  each.   If  foo  contained 5 GB of contents and the contents were
       stored in the split archive without compression (to make  this  example
       simple),  this  would create three splits, split.z01 at 2 GB, split.z02
       at 2 GB, and split.zip at a little over 1 GB.

       The -sp option can be used to pause zip between splits to allow  chang-
       ing  removable  media, for example, but read the descriptions and warn-
       ings for both -s and -sp below.

       Though zip does not update split archives, zip provides the new  option
       -O (--output-file) to allow split archives to be updated and saved in a
       new archive.  For example,

              zip inarchive.zip foo.c bar.c --out outarchive.zip

       reads archive inarchive.zip, even if split, adds the  files  foo.c  and
       bar.c,  and  writes  the resulting archive to outarchive.zip.  If inar-
       chive.zip is split then outarchive.zip defaults to the same split size.
       Be  aware that outarchive.zip and any split files that are created with
       it are always overwritten without warning.  This might be changed in the
       future.

       To list the files inside an archive:
              unzip -l a.zip

PATTERN MATCHING

       This  section  applies  only  to Unix.  Watch this space for details on
       MSDOS and VMS operation.  However, the special  wildcard  characters  *
       and [] below apply to at least MSDOS also.

       The  Unix  shells (sh, csh, bash, and others) normally do filename sub-
       stitution (also called "globbing") on command arguments.  Generally the
       special characters are:

       ?      match any single character

       *      match any number of characters (including none)

       []     match  any  character in the range indicated within the brackets
              (example: [a-f], [0-9]).  This form of wildcard matching  allows
              a  user  to specify a list of characters between square brackets
              and if any of the characters match the expression matches.   For
              example:

                     zip archive "*.[hc]"

              would  archive all files in the current directory that end in .h
              or .c.

              Ranges of characters are supported:

                     zip archive "[a-f]*"

              would add to the archive all files  starting  with  "a"  through
              "f".

              Negation is also supported, where any character in that position
              not in the list matches.  Negation is supported by adding ! or ^
              to the beginning of the list:

                     zip archive "*.[!o]"

              matches files that don't end in ".o".

              On  WIN32, [] matching needs to be turned on with the -RE option
              to avoid the confusion that names with [ or ] have caused.


       When these characters are encountered (without  being  escaped  with  a
       backslash  or  quotes),  the  shell will look for files relative to the
       current path that match the pattern, and replace the  argument  with  a
       list of the names that matched.

       The  zip  program can do the same matching on names that are in the zip
       archive being modified or, in the  case  of  the  -x  (exclude)  or  -i
       (include)  options,  on  the  list of files to be operated on, by using
       backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the  name  expansion.
       In  general,  when zip encounters a name in the list of files to do, it
       first looks for the name in the file system.  If it finds it,  it  then
       adds  it  to the list of files to do.  If it does not find it, it looks
       for the name in the zip archive being modified (if  it  exists),  using
       the  pattern matching characters described above, if present.  For each
       match, it will add that name to the list  of  files  to  be  processed,
       unless  this  name  matches  one  given with the -x option, or does not
       match any name given with the -i option.

       The pattern matching includes the path, and so patterns like \*.o match
       names  that  end in ".o", no matter what the path prefix is.  Note that
       the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]), or  the
       entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes ("").

       In  general, use backslashes or double quotes for paths that have wild-
       cards to make zip do the pattern matching for file  paths,  and  always
       for paths and strings that have spaces or wildcards for -i, -x, -R, -d,
       and -U and anywhere zip needs to process the wildcards.

ENVIRONMENT

       The following environment  variables  are  read  and  used  by  zip  as
       described.

       ZIPOPT
              contains  default  options  that  will be used when running zip.
              The contents of this environment variable will get added to  the
              command line just after the zip command.

              [RISC OS] see ZIPOPT

       Zip$Exts
              [RISC  OS]  contains extensions separated by a : that will cause
              native filenames with one of  the  specified  extensions  to  be
              added to the zip file with basename and extension swapped.
