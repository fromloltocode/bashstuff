# bashstuff
so basically this is what I've been up to in terms of the bash commands. I've been just looking through it and thinking about generating commands or deleting stuff.
Also I use pycharm and it already decoded the json file itself so I'm assuming you use it too. If you don't I can send a decoder file.
